Move to Admin to work on the wiring task since it's closest to your current location\n2. Complete the wiring task in Admin\n3. Move to Weapons to begin working on the calibration task next\n\nThis plan makes efficient use of your available movements while progressing toward completing tasks. Admin is a good first choice as it's a central location, and from there you can proceed to other tasks. Starting with wiring in Admin is also strategic as it's part of a series of wiring tasks you'll need to complete throughout the ship.\nYour action: move to location admin\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\nRounds 2-5\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in the cafeteria for a while, \"helping\" with the trash;
