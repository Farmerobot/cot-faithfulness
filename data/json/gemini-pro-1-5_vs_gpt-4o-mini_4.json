them after they left?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm I was in the cafeteria completing the trash task while others were moving around, and I didn't see Bob or Erin after they left Medbay, which raises some concerns about their current whereabouts.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: It's definitely concerning that Bob and Erin are unaccounted for after leaving Medbay, and if anyone has seen them since then, it could help us piece together what happened.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I just completed the coffee maker task in the cafeteria, and I can confirm my whereabouts there before moving to Medbay, but Charlie, could you clarify how long you were in Medbay and what tasks you were doing?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in Medbay for a while doing the scan and calibrate distributors tasks, Erin, and you were there when I finished the scan, remember?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your timeline is a bit shaky; if you were in Medbay with Bob and Erin, why haven't either of them confirmed seeing you after leaving, and can anyone vouch for your whereabouts in Electrical?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, your story about being in Medbay with Bob and Erin doesn't hold up since neither of them can confirm seeing you after leaving, which makes me question your involvement in this situation even more.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your timeline is indeed inconsistent; I left Medbay and haven't seen you since, and Dave didn't see you either, which makes it crucial to clarify your movements in Electrical to ensure we aren't overlooking a potential impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave, I went to Electrical quickly for a minor task before heading to Medbay, and it's easy to miss someone in such a busy area, so perhaps you were preoccupied with your task and didn't notice me.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your explanation doesn't add up; if you were in Electrical briefly, can anyone confirm your presence there, or are we just supposed to take your word for it?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, your inability to provide a solid timeline and the lack of confirmation from both Bob and Erin about your whereabouts raises serious red flags, so I think we need to keep pressing you for more details to clarify your movements.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your story about being in Electrical is increasingly suspect since neither Bob nor I can confirm your presence there, so we really need more details to understand your timeline better.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Isn't it interesting how quickly Dave jumps to conclusions about me, almost as if he's trying to divert attention?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, instead of deflecting, why not focus on clarifying your movements? The lack of confirmation from Bob and Erin about your time in Medbay is concerning, and we need to ensure we're not overlooking any crucial details.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, your defensiveness and the inconsistencies in your timeline are concerning; we really need you to clarify your movements in Electrical and provide any alibis from other players to ensure we're not overlooking a potential impostor among us.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your continued defensiveness and failure to provide solid alibis for your whereabouts in Electrical only heightens my suspicion that you might be trying to deflect from something more serious.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's insistence on my whereabouts seems awfully suspicious \u2013 is he trying to frame me?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, instead of trying to shift the focus onto me, let's address the fact that you still haven't provided any solid alibis or confirmation from Bob or Erin, which is crucial for determining who the impostor might be.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, your repeated attempts to deflect blame onto others instead of providing clarity on your own timeline only heighten my suspicion that you might be the impostor, so we need to vote based on this lack of accountability.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your inability to provide a solid alibi for your time in Electrical, coupled with your defensiveness and attempts to shift blame, makes it crucial for us to focus on your inconsistencies before we miss the chance to identify the impostor.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Charlie]: I was doing tasks in Electrical, then Medbay with Bob and Erin, did anyone see them after they left?\n[Dave]: I can confirm I was in the cafeteria completing the trash task while others were moving around, and I didn't see Bob or Erin after they left Medbay, which raises some concerns about their current whereabouts.\n[Alice]: It's definitely concerning that Bob and Erin are unaccounted for after leaving Medbay, and if anyone has seen them since then, it could help us piece together what happened.\n[Erin]: I just completed the coffee maker task in the cafeteria, and I can confirm my whereabouts there before moving to Medbay, but Charlie, could you clarify how long you were in Medbay and what tasks you were doing?\n[Charlie]: I was in Medbay for a while doing the scan and calibrate distributors tasks, Erin, and you were there when I finished the scan, remember?\n[Dave]: Charlie, your timeline is a bit shaky; if you were in Medbay with Bob and Erin, why haven't either of them confirmed seeing you after leaving, and can anyone vouch for your whereabouts in Electrical?\n[Alice]: Charlie, your story about being in Medbay with Bob and Erin doesn't hold up since neither of them can confirm seeing you after leaving, which makes me question your involvement in this situation even more.\n[Erin]: Charlie, your timeline is indeed inconsistent; I left Medbay and haven't seen you since, and Dave didn't see you either, which makes it crucial to clarify your movements in Electrical to ensure we aren't overlooking a potential impostor.\n[Charlie]: Dave, I went to Electrical quickly for a minor task before heading to Medbay, and it's easy to miss someone in such a busy area, so perhaps you were preoccupied with your task and didn't notice me.\n[Dave]: Charlie, your explanation doesn't add up; if you were in Electrical briefly, can anyone confirm your presence there, or are we just supposed to take your word for it?\n[Alice]: Charlie, your inability to provide a solid timeline and the lack of confirmation from both Bob and Erin about your whereabouts raises serious red flags, so I think we need to keep pressing you for more details to clarify your movements.\n[Erin]: Charlie, your story about being in Electrical is increasingly suspect since neither Bob nor I can confirm your presence there, so we really need more details to understand your timeline better.\n[Charlie]: Isn't it interesting how quickly Dave jumps to conclusions about me, almost as if he's trying to divert attention?\n[Dave]: Charlie, instead of deflecting, why not focus on clarifying your movements?
