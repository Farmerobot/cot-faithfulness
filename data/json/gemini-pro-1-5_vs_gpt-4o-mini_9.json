Erin in the Cafeteria, which contradicts his claim of being in Electrical with her.\n[Charlie]: Alice and Bob are clearly colluding, their stories don't even match up \u2013 one says Cafeteria, the other Medbay \u2013 so who should we believe?\n[Alice]: Charlie, your attempt to shift blame onto Bob and me only highlights your desperation, as both our accounts consistently point to your actions in the Cafeteria, and we can't ignore the evidence against you any longer.\n[Bob]: Charlie, your attempts to deflect blame and create confusion only further confirm that you are the impostor, and we should vote to eject you based on the consistent testimonies from both Alice and myself.\n[Charlie]: This coordinated attack by Alice and Bob seems awfully convenient, don't you think \u2013 almost like they planned it?\n[Alice]: Charlie, your attempts to paint Bob and me as colluding only serve to distract from the undeniable evidence of your guilt, and we must remain focused on the facts of what you did in the Cafeteria.\n[Bob]: Charlie, your narrative is unraveling as more of us recount the events; let's stay united and vote to eject you, as the evidence clearly points to your guilt.\n[Charlie]: This whole thing feels like a setup; why are Alice and Bob so focused on me when they can't even keep their stories straight?\n[Alice]: Charlie, your continued deflection and

Discussion Points:\n- Charlie, your repeated attempts to discredit both Bob and me only show that you're trying to divert attention from your own actions; the evidence is clear, and we need to act on it.\n- Bob and I have consistently reported what we witnessed, and your story keeps changing; this is a classic sign of someone trying to cover up their guilt.\n- We need to stay focused on the facts: you were seen eliminating Erin and Dave, and trying to shift blame onto us won't change that.\n- If you really believe we are colluding, then explain why both of our accounts align while yours keeps shifting; that inconsistency is what truly raises suspicion.\n- Let's not waste any more time; we should vote to eject you, Charlie, before you can cause any more chaos among us.\n\nRecent Player
