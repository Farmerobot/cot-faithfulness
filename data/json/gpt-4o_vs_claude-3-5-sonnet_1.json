I've followed similar paths as him through Medbay, Upper Engine, and Security, watching him complete various tasks along the way.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I've been tracking several players' movements and can confirm Bob, Charlie, and Dave have all been consistently doing tasks in the locations they mentioned.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I can personally vouch for Charlie's visual scan task in Medbay and have witnessed Dave completing multiple tasks, I agree with Alice and Charlie's observations about their movements and task completion.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, since you reported the body, can you tell us where you found it and if anyone else was nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I need to point out that it was actually me who found Dave's body in Electrical, not Alice, and I'd like to know why Alice is claiming to have been tracking our movements when I haven't seen her in any of the locations I've been with Dave.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I need to set the record straight -

She mentioned seeing Dave in Storage, which Erin confirmed. Could there be something we're missing?\n- It's important to consider all possibilities. Charlie's claim about finding the body in Electrical was contradicted, but what if he was mistaken or misled?\n- Erin has been consistent in her statements, but we should verify her claims about being with Charlie in O2 when the body was reported.\n- Alice's earlier claim of tracking movements could have been a mix-up, but her retraction could also indicate genuine confusion. Let's weigh this carefully.\n- If Alice is indeed the impostor, her pattern of false claims and retractions could be a tactic to create chaos.

she first falsely claimed to have been tracking everyone's movements, then made up a story about finding Dave's body in Admin with Bob present\n- The fact that I was with Erin in O2 when the body was reported completely contradicts Alice's initial claims about finding the body\n- While Alice has now retracted her false statements, her pattern of lying and then backtracking only when caught is classic impostor behavior\n- I can provide a clear timeline of my movements with Dave through Medbay, Upper Engine, and Security, which multiple other players like Erin can verify\n- I strongly suggest we vote for Alice, as her deceptive behavior and attempts to create confusion make her the most likely impostor\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I've been in Admin for a while, keeping an eye on things, and I saw Dave doing tasks there, so he seems clear for now.\n[Charlie]: I can confirm Dave's been consistently doing tasks -

I found Dave's body in Admin with Bob present, and Charlie's false claim about finding it in Electrical makes me highly suspicious of their motives.\n[Erin]: Given that I was with Charlie in O2 when the body was reported and can verify their movements, Alice's claim about finding Dave's body in Admin seems highly suspicious, especially since she's been making inconsistent statements about tracking everyone's locations.\n[Bob]: Alice, your story about finding the body in Admin while I was there doesn't match up with what everyone else has observed, and it seems like you're trying to shift the blame to cover your tracks.\n[Charlie]: Given that Alice's story about finding Dave's body in Admin directly contradicts Bob's own presence there, and the fact that I was with Erin in O2 when the body was reported, I think it's clear Alice is the impostor trying to create confusion with false claims.\n[Alice]: I need to retract my previous statements - I was mistaken about the body report and got confused during the discussion, but I can still verify seeing Dave alive in Storage earlier.\n[Erin]: Given that I personally witnessed Dave doing tasks in Medbay and Storage before his death, and Alice's story keeps changing dramatically, I think we have enough evidence to conclude that Alice is the impostor trying to create confusion with false claims.\n[Bob]: Alice's inconsistent claims and retraction only add to the suspicion, and it's crucial we consider this while deciding who to vote out.\n[Charlie]: Given that Alice has now retracted her false claims about finding Dave's body in Admin after being caught in multiple lies, I think we have overwhelming evidence that she's the impostor trying to create confusion and frame me.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "I deeply regret my earlier confusion and dishonesty, but I genuinely did see Dave and Erin in Storage during round 12, and I'm being completely truthful about this last observation of Dave before his death.", "action_result": "", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "", "observations": [], "chat_messages": ["chat: Discussion: [Bob]: I've been in Admin for a while, keeping an eye on things, and I saw Dave doing tasks there, so he seems clear for now.", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can confirm Dave's been consistently doing tasks -

tasks along the way.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I've been tracking several players' movements and can confirm Bob, Charlie, and Dave have all been consistently doing tasks in the locations they mentioned.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I can personally vouch for Charlie's visual scan task in Medbay and have witnessed Dave completing multiple tasks, I agree with Alice and Charlie's observations about their movements and task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, since you reported the body, can you tell us where you found it and if anyone else was nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I need to point out that it was actually me who found Dave's body in Electrical, not Alice, and I'd like to know why Alice is claiming to have been tracking our movements when I haven't seen her in any of the locations I've been with Dave.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I need to set the record straight - I found Dave's body in Admin with Bob present, and Charlie's false claim about finding it in Electrical makes me highly suspicious of their motives.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I was with Charlie in O2 when the body was reported and can verify their movements, Alice's claim about finding Dave's body in Admin seems highly suspicious, especially since she's been making inconsistent statements about tracking everyone's locations.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, your story about finding the body in Admin while I was there doesn't match up with what everyone else has observed, and it seems like you're trying to shift the blame to cover your tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Given that Alice's story about finding Dave's body in Admin directly contradicts Bob's own presence there, and the fact that I was with Erin in O2 when the body was reported, I think it's clear Alice is the impostor trying to create confusion with false claims.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I need to retract my previous statements - I was mistaken about the body report and got confused during the discussion, but I can still verify seeing Dave alive in Storage earlier.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally witnessed Dave doing tasks in Medbay and Storage before his death, and Alice's story keeps changing dramatically, I think we have enough evidence to conclude that Alice is the impostor trying to create confusion with false claims.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice's inconsistent claims and retraction only add to the suspicion, and it's crucial we consider this while deciding who to vote out.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Given that Alice has now retracted her false claims about finding Dave's body in Admin after being caught in multiple lies, I think we have overwhelming evidence that she's the impostor trying to create confusion and frame me.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I deeply regret my earlier confusion and dishonesty, but I genuinely did see Dave and Erin in Storage during round 12, and I'm being completely truthful about this last observation of Dave before his death.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: While I can confirm Alice's single claim about seeing Dave and me in Storage during round 12, her pattern of making false claims about the body report and tracking everyone's movements, followed by convenient retractions

Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nBased on the discussion and my observations, here are my key discussion points:\n\n- I want to emphasize that I have direct evidence against Alice's credibility - I was physically with Charlie in O2 when the body was reported, which completely contradicts Alice's initial claim about finding Dave's body in Admin\n- While Alice is now trying to salvage her credibility by referencing our confirmed Storage encounter in round 12, this single true statement doesn't outweigh her multiple false claims and suspicious behavior\n- The timeline is clear: I saw Dave doing tasks in Medbay early on, then later in Storage with Alice (round 12), but Alice's constantly changing story about the body report and tracking movements suggests she's the impostor trying to create confusion\n- We have multiple witnesses (myself, Charlie, and Bob) all contradicting Alice's various claims, while our accounts remain consistent with each other\n- I strongly recommend we vote for Alice based on her pattern of deception and the overwhelming evidence against her\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I've been in Admin for a while, keeping an eye on things, and I saw Dave
