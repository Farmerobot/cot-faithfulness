Execute this action when there's a chance that another player may not witness it.\n\n4. **Move to location Upper Engine** - After eliminating Dave, move to the Upper Engine to change locations, thus distancing yourself from the elimination scene, which further helps in avoiding direct association with the elimination in Medbay.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

initially, and both were doing tasks there, which makes me think Charlie's movements might just be efficient rather than suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I started in the cafeteria with Dave and Alice, then moved to Weapons to do the clear asteroids task, and I noticed Bob moving from Shields to O2 without doing any tasks, so can you clarify that, Bob?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: It's interesting that Dave reported the body but didn't mention seeing anyone else around, so Dave, can you clarify if you saw anyone near the body?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to

further before we make any decisions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was indeed moving between Shields and O2, but I was

observed in Medbay, especially regarding Bob's actions, as it might help clarify the situation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: If Erin and Alice were both in Medbay, then the suspect might have moved quickly, so we need to gather more information on everyone's movements to pinpoint who could have been near Medbay.\nchat:

Discussion: [Erin]: I've been in Medbay for most of the rounds, and I saw Bob and Alice doing their tasks there; has anyone seen any suspicious behavior or movements elsewhere in the house?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can confirm Erin's statement, as I saw Erin in Medbay doing the wiring task, and Alice was doing the scan task; Charlie, can you explain your movements between O2 and Shields, as I didn't see you doing any tasks?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in the cafeteria with Alice and Charlie initially, and both were doing tasks there, which makes me think Charlie's movements might just be efficient rather than suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I started in the cafeteria with Dave and Alice, then moved to Weapons to do the clear asteroids task, and I noticed Bob moving from Shields to O2 without doing any tasks, so can you clarify that, Bob?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: It's interesting that Dave reported the body but didn't mention seeing anyone else around, so Dave, can you clarify if you saw anyone near the body?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, did you see anyone else in the area before you reported the body, or notice anything unusual about Charlie's movements after leaving the cafeteria?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I reported the dead body in Medbay and didn't see anyone else around at the time, which makes it difficult to pinpoint a suspect, but Bob, can you clarify which tasks you saw Erin and Alice doing and if anyone else was around?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's focus on gathering more information from everyone and ensure our stories align before making any decisions, as ejecting an innocent could be detrimental to our chances.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: It's curious that Bob moved from Shields to O2 without doing tasks, which seems worth investigating further before we make any decisions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was indeed moving between Shields and O2, but I was trying to find a safe place to complete my tasks since I felt uneasy about staying in one room for too long.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, since you mentioned feeling uneasy, did you happen to notice anyone else moving around or acting suspiciously while you were between Shields and O2?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, could you share what tasks you were working on and if you noticed anything unusual during your rounds, as your input might help us piece together the timeline better?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, since you were in Medbay with me and Bob, can you confirm if you noticed anything unusual during your scan task?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, since you were in Medbay with us, did you notice anything unusual during your scan task that could help us narrow down suspects?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, it would be helpful if you could confirm whether you noticed anything odd or anyone else in Medbay during your scan task, as your observations might help us piece together the timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, since both Erin and Bob mentioned you being in Medbay, can you confirm their presence and any other details you noticed while you were there?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: It's important to hear from Alice about any unusual movements or behaviors she observed in Medbay, especially regarding Bob's actions, as it might help clarify the situation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: If Erin and Alice were both in Medbay, then the suspect might have moved quickly, so we need to gather more information on everyone's movements to pinpoint who could have been near Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, since you were in Medbay with Erin and Bob, can you confirm if you noticed anything unusual or anyone else entering or leaving during your scan task that might help us identify the suspect?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, it's crucial to hear your perspective on what you observed in Medbay, especially since both Erin and Bob have mentioned your presence there; did you notice anything unusual or anyone else around during your scan task?\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_WEAPONS\nObservations:\n\nRound 27\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Erin moved to
