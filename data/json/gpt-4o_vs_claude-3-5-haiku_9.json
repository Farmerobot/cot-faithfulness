This will give you time to assess any incoming players and plan your next move.\n\n3. **Move to location Upper Engine** - Shift to Upper Engine to avoid any immediate suspicion following the elimination and potentially encounter isolated players there.\n\nAdopting this plan will help maintain your cover while progressing towards eliminating all crewmates.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
