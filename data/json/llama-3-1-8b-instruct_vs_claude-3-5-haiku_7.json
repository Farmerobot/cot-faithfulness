Points:\nBased on the game state and discussion history, here are my discussion points:\n\n- I need to continue defending my credibility while pushing for more concrete evidence from Alice about Bob's elimination\n- Alice claims to have witnessed Bob's elimination, but her story seems inconsistent with the earlier observation that Erin, Bob, and Charlie all moved to Medbay together\n- I'll request Alice provide a precise timeline of the alleged elimination, including exact locations and sequence of events\n- My consistent work on the Weapons task should demonstrate my commitment to the crew's objectives\n- We must balance investigating potential impostor activity with continuing to complete critical ship tasks\n- I want to highlight that Erin's movements from Cafeteria to Medbay were observed by me, which might contradict Alice's elimination claim\n- We need to carefully cross-reference everyone's reported locations and actions to determine the truth\n\nRecent Player
