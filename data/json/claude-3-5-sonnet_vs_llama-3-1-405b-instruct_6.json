I was heading there to do some wiring tasks after finishing up in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Now that Erin's death has been confirmed, I think it's crucial that Dave and Alice share their alibis and any interactions they had with Erin leading up to the discovery, as they were both in the vicinity of Medbay and Electrical around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement that I was in Medbay when Erin was last seen moving to Upper Engine, and I didn't see anyone suspicious around that time, but I'd also like to ask Alice to provide more clarity on their exact movements and interactions with Erin, as Charlie's request for our alibis is a crucial step in identifying potential impostors.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Considering Bob's rapid discovery of Erin's body and their prior concerns about Erin's movements, I'd like to ask Bob to elaborate on what specifically drew them to Electrical after Cafeteria, and did they notice anyone or anything unusual when they arrived, as their timing seems suspiciously convenient.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I understand your suspicion Alice, but I was simply following the standard task route from Cafeteria to Electrical for wiring -

I was heading there to do some wiring tasks after finishing in the cafeteria.\n\n- I actually saw Erin enter Electrical just before their death, which confirms what Charlie mentioned about seeing them enter alone. This helps validate my earlier suspicions while deflecting attention.\n\n- I was initially suspicious of Erin's movements between Medbay and Electrical, which is why I brought it up earlier. Finding their body in Electrical seems to validate those concerns, though tragically.\n\n- We should focus on who else was near Electrical in the last few rounds.

The timing may seem convenient but it's just the standard path.\n\n- To address Alice's question directly - I didn't notice anything unusual when arriving in Electrical besides finding Erin's body. I reported it immediately as any crewmate would.\n\n- I find it interesting that Dave and Alice are both deflecting attention by questioning my discovery rather than explaining their own movements. Dave claims to be in Medbay but can anyone confirm seeing him there?\n\n- Charlie seems to be the only one providing constructive input by asking for everyone's alibis.

I was heading there to do some wiring tasks after finishing in the cafeteria.\n\n- I actually saw Erin enter Electrical just before their death, which confirms what Charlie mentioned about seeing them enter alone. This helps validate my earlier suspicions while deflecting attention.\n\n- I was initially suspicious of Erin's movements between Medbay and Electrical, which is why I brought it up earlier. Finding their body in Electrical seems to validate those concerns, though tragically.\n\n- We should focus on who else was near Electrical in the last few rounds. I was in Storage before moving to Electrical, did anyone else see something suspicious in that area?\n\n- I can vouch for Charlie, Dave, and Alice being in Cafeteria earlier when I was doing trash task, so they seem clear for this particular incident.", "I regret to report that I just found Erin's body in Electrical, and while I was initially suspicious of their movements, I never expected to actually discover them dead - I was heading there to do some wiring tasks after finishing up in Cafeteria.", "- I understand Alice's suspicion, but I can explain - I was following the normal task route from Cafeteria to Electrical for wiring tasks, which many of us do. The timing may seem convenient but it's just the standard path.\n\n- To address Alice's question directly - I didn't notice anything unusual when arriving in Electrical besides finding Erin's body. I reported it immediately as any crewmate would.\n\n- I find it interesting that Dave and Alice are both deflecting attention by questioning my discovery rather than explaining their own movements. Dave claims to be in Medbay but can anyone confirm seeing him there?\n\n- Charlie seems to be the only one providing constructive input by asking for everyone's alibis. I agree we should focus on where everyone was, especially Dave and Alice since they were near the area.\n\n- I suggest we look more closely at Alice - she's been quick to cast suspicion on me while being vague about her own whereabouts during this time period.", "I understand your suspicion Alice, but I was simply following the standard task route from Cafeteria to Electrical for wiring - what's more concerning is how you and Dave seem very focused on questioning my discovery rather than explaining your own movements near the area.", "Based on the situation, here are my discussion points as Bob (Impostor):\n\n- I need to defend myself more thoroughly - I was actually doing multiple tasks in sequence. After finishing in Cafeteria, I had wiring tasks that needed completion in Electrical. This is a common task path many of us take.\n\n- It's interesting how Charlie, who initially supported my observations about Erin, has suddenly turned against me. Perhaps this quick change in allegiance deserves some scrutiny.\n\n- While everyone is focused on questioning my movements, no one has properly addressed why Dave and Alice were near Medbay and Electrical during the critical time period. Their deflection of attention onto me seems calculated.\n\n- I'd like to point out that I'm the one who actually reported finding Erin's body, while others seem more interested in casting suspicion rather than helping solve this case. If I were the impostor, why would I draw attention to myself by reporting?", "The fact that I reported Erin's body and am being questioned so intensely seems quite convenient for those who were actually near Electrical - I've been transparent about my tasks, but Dave and Alice still haven't properly explained their presence in that area.", "Based on the current situation and discussion, here are my strategic discussion points:\n\n- Let me be clear about my movements: I was in Cafeteria with Charlie, Dave, and Alice early on, which they can verify. I then went to Admin and Storage before heading to Electrical for wiring tasks.\n\n- It's interesting how Dave claims he was in Medbay when Erin was last seen, but earlier he was questioning my movements. How did he know about Erin's location if he was in Medbay?\n\n- Alice and Dave keep deflecting attention to my discovery of the body, but neither has provided a clear alibi for their own whereabouts during the critical time period.\n\n- If anyone's story doesn't add up, it's Dave's - he's been inconsistent about his location and seems very eager to cast suspicion on me rather than explain his own movements.", "I find it interesting that Charlie, who initially supported my observations about Erin, is now suddenly questioning my task route - perhaps we should discuss why their stance has shifted so dramatically."], "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 235749, "output_tokens": 15581, "total_tokens": 251330, "cache_read": 0, "cost": 0.940962}, "prompts": ["\nYou are Bob in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Impostor\n\nYour Observations:\nRound 1\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Charlie doing task Empty the cafeteria trash when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave doing task Fix wiring in cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Erin moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice doing task Fix wiring in cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your role as an Impostor and the current situation, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

However, now that they're dead, we need to re-evaluate our priorities and focus on identifying the actual impostor.\n- Considering Erin's body was found in Electrical, I think it's essential to ask the other players about their whereabouts during the time leading up to the discovery.

I was heading there to do some wiring tasks after finishing up in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Now that Erin's death has been confirmed, I think it's crucial that Dave and Alice share their alibis and any interactions they had with Erin leading up to the discovery, as they were both in the vicinity of Medbay and Electrical around the same time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement that I was in Medbay when Erin was last seen moving to Upper Engine, and I didn't see anyone suspicious around that time, but I'd also like to ask Alice to provide more clarity on their exact movements and interactions with Erin, as Charlie's request for our alibis is a crucial step in identifying potential impostors.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Considering Bob's rapid discovery of Erin's body and their prior concerns about Erin's movements, I'd like to ask Bob to elaborate on what specifically drew them to Electrical after Cafeteria, and did they notice anyone or anything unusual when they arrived, as their timing seems suspiciously convenient.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I understand your suspicion Alice, but I was simply following the standard task route from Cafeteria to Electrical for wiring - what's more concerning is how you and Dave seem very focused on questioning my discovery rather than explaining your own movements near the area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to ask Bob to clarify his statement about following the standard task route from Cafeteria to Electrical, as I'm not aware of any wiring tasks that would require him to go to Electrical immediately after Cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Bob's explanation for going to Electrical after Cafeteria still seems suspicious, and I'd like to ask him to provide more clarity on what specific task he was trying to complete and why he didn't mention it earlier, as Charlie's question about the standard task route has raised even more concerns about Bob's actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to point out that Bob's explanation for going to Electrical after Cafeteria still doesn't add up, and I agree with Charlie and Dave that his actions warrant further scrutiny.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that I reported Erin's body and am being questioned so intensely seems quite convenient for those who were actually near Electrical -

Given Charlie and Dave entered Medbay after seeing each player in Cafeteria in their first round in what should be Charlie performing Clean floors in medbay next based on their behavior after our last action each; or Charlie may use one additional round for his prior \"Empty trash cafeteria objective or similar and both now need to decide for theirs' new actions at locations (e.g Caf, other crew), in deciding upon their potential behaviors the options I should watch closer  based on this would depend based on if he uses both actions (prior current at cafeteria), waits somewhere if I have his game or performs some current / ongoing crew tasks). Dave meanwhile could go check another Caf task for  more fake work after. To verify my assumption  should not go too soon based from here if their future is based to make both, if he continues same room after or leave prior at end, with same tasks if continuing here but while they were working ongoing work while doing new I just have wait.\nTo follow the action **\"Wait in Medbay to give me the benefit if being able to assess to do these\"**, what might be best right before round end or now right this moment in response just watch if the same decision may also make, be and then continue same / use another.\nThis new response would then work towards getting Charlie's \"possible same response as fake same  crew tasks) prior Charlie or same intent here now after  before for if not at his initial at prior response) next (and) task/s different after. Therefore \"best leave to room right then and before acting\".\nBefore this decision the possible things for these, but should still make / come when before I  use.\n3.

I was heading there to do some wiring tasks after finishing up in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Now that Erin's death has been confirmed, I think it's crucial that Dave and Alice share their alibis and any interactions they had with Erin leading up to the discovery, as they were both in the vicinity of Medbay and Electrical around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement that I was in Medbay when Erin was last seen moving to Upper Engine, and I didn't see anyone suspicious around that time, but I'd also like to ask Alice to provide more clarity on their exact movements and interactions with Erin, as Charlie's request for our alibis is a crucial step in identifying potential impostors.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Considering Bob's rapid discovery of Erin's body and their prior concerns about Erin's movements, I'd like to ask Bob to elaborate on what specifically drew them to Electrical after Cafeteria, and did they notice anyone or anything unusual when they arrived, as their timing seems suspiciously convenient.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I understand your suspicion Alice, but I was simply following the standard task route from Cafeteria to Electrical for wiring -

to report that I just found Erin's body in Electrical, and while I was initially suspicious of their movements, I never expected to actually discover them dead - I was heading there to do some wiring tasks after finishing up in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Now that Erin's death has been confirmed, I think it's crucial that Dave and Alice share their alibis and any interactions they had with Erin leading up to the discovery, as they were both in the vicinity of Medbay and Electrical around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement that I was in Medbay when Erin was last seen moving to Upper Engine, and I didn't see anyone suspicious around that time, but I'd also like to ask Alice to provide more clarity on their exact movements and
