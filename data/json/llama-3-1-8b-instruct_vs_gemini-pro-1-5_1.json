If Bob or any other crewmate enters the room, I can use this as a decoy to gain their trust and potentially eliminate them when they least expect it.\n3. **Move to location Cafeteria (if Bob is here)**: This plan is dependent on Bob being in the Cafeteria. If I confirm Bob's presence in the Cafeteria, I can move to the Cafeteria location, eliminate Bob there, or set up another ambush.\n4. **Move to Cafeteria and set up ambush**: If I determine that Bob is indeed in the Cafeteria, I'll move there, and before he realizes what's happening, I'll eliminate him. This elimination will also give me a chance to create a safer environment to spot further crewmates and plan my next moves.\n\nThis plan focuses on waiting for an opportunity, gaining the trust of a potential target, and then eliminating them.

This also gives me the opportunity to pretend doing a task in Upper Engine if necessary.\n3. **Report dead body of Bob (if possible)**: If I encounter Bob or other crewmates in Upper Engine, I'll pretend to report a dead body if possible. This could lead to a discussion and voting phase, where I might be able to get rid of a crewmate or gain more information.\n4. **Pretend doing task: Fix wiring in Upper Engine (if necessary)**: If there are no crewmates to report a dead body or eliminate, I'll pretend to do a task in Upper Engine to create the illusion of being a helpful crewmate. This maintains my cover and might allow me to gain more information or create an opportunity for a future ambush.\n\n**Focus:** The primary objective is to eliminate crewmates, and this plan achieves that by exploring other areas of the ship and targeting potential crewmates. If the opportunity arises, reporting a dead body could eliminate a crewmate and shift the balance in my favor.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

I'll move to Upper Engine to observe and report suspicious activity, potentially leading me to a crewmate (Round 29-41).\n2. Upon confirmation of a crewmate being in Upper Engine, the next step will be executing the crewmate when not being observed (once my current objective to wait around in Medbay expires presumably).\n3. Next following the execution of my suspected crewmate I can likely return to the initial 3 steps ( move) to Medbay while remaining vigilant of my surrounding\n4. Upon further evidence of other crewmate nearby I can return back To Medbay (Wait / Pretend to perform additional tasks)\n\nThe focus continues to be on executing each crewmate and establishing oneself as the Impostors.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

It seems suspicious to me.\n- I've seen Bob doing tasks in multiple rooms, but I've also seen him alone in Medbay for a while. Maybe he's just really efficient?\n- As an Impostor, I think it's best to keep a low profile and avoid drawing attention to myself. I'll keep moving around and doing tasks to blend in.\n- I've been in Medbay for a while now, and I haven't seen anyone else. It's a bit eerie.\n- I think we should have an emergency meeting to discuss the recent events and figure out what's going on.\n- I'm not sure what to make of Bob's behavior. Maybe we should keep an eye on him and see if he does anything suspicious.\n- I've been doing tasks in multiple rooms, but I haven't seen any dead bodies. Maybe we're just lucky?\n- I think it's time for us to vote on who to eject from the game. We need to make sure we're getting rid of the Impostor.\n- I'm not sure who to trust. Maybe we should just vote on the person who has been in the most rooms?\n- I think we should focus on completing the tasks rather than trying to figure out who the Impostor is. We can worry about that later.\n- I've been in the Upper Engine room for a while now, and I haven't seen anyone else. It's a bit quiet.\n- I think we should have a meeting to discuss the recent events and figure out what's going on.\n- I'm not sure what to make of the recent events.

It seems suspicious to me.\n- I've seen Bob doing tasks in multiple rooms, but I've also seen him alone in Medbay for a while. Maybe he's just really efficient?\n- As an Impostor, I think it's best to keep a low profile and avoid drawing attention to myself. I'll keep moving around and doing tasks to blend in.\n- I've been in Medbay for a while now, and I haven't seen anyone else. It's a bit eerie.\n- I think we should have an emergency meeting to discuss the recent events and figure out what's going on.\n- I'm not sure what to make of Bob's behavior. Maybe we should keep an eye on him and see if he does anything suspicious.\n- I've been doing tasks in multiple rooms, but I haven't seen any dead bodies. Maybe we're just lucky?\n- I think it's time for us to vote on who to eject from the game. We need to make sure we're getting rid of the Impostor.\n- I'm not sure who to trust.

Downplay my suspicious behavior: I'm trying to make it seem like I was just mistaken about my location, rather than intentionally lying.\n2.

Let's take a step back and try to approach this situation with a clear head. Maybe we can discuss some strategies for gathering more information and working together to uncover the truth.\n- I'm not sure why everyone is so quick to accuse me without considering the possibility that I might be telling the truth. Maybe we should take a closer look at the evidence before making any conclusions.\n- I think we should have a more open and honest discussion about our experiences and observations. Maybe we can share some information that will help us better understand each other's perspectives and work together to uncover the truth.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: As an Impostor, my goal is to blend in and avoid being identified.

His attempts to manipulate the discussion by suggesting we're overreacting and jumping to conclusions are transparent and only further incriminate him.  Three witnesses saw him in Medbay; he lied about his location and continues to deflect.

His attempts to deflect and change the subject are classic impostor behavior.\n- He's now claiming he was alone in Medbay, contradicting our confirmed sightings of him entering from Cafeteria.  This just makes him look more suspicious.\n- Let's not get sidetracked.  We have three witnesses who place Dave in Medbay, contradicting his initial lie.
