in Medbay and were also seen in the Cafeteria earlier, it seems like they're trying to complete tasks quickly to gain our trust, but it's also possible they're trying to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I've been in Weapons the entire game focusing on tasks, so I can't comment on Charlie's movements, but Dave's observation about their quick task completion warrants further investigation; can Charlie clarify their whereabouts?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I agree with Dave and Erin that Charlie's quick task completion is worth investigating, but let's hear their explanation before making accusations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given my previous concerns about Charlie's behavior and their untimely death in Medbay, I think it's crucial that we shift our focus to figuring out who might have been responsible, and Erin, your alibi of being in Weapons the entire game seems solid, but can you confirm if you saw or interacted with anyone who might have been heading towards Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I've focused solely on Weapons tasks, making my observations about other areas unreliable, but let's prioritize gathering complete movement accounts from everyone else to build a clearer picture of what happened.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Admin and Storage completing tasks and didn't see Charlie, but a detailed timeline of everyone's movements before the body was reported is essential to finding the imposter.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate the importance of a detailed timeline and propose that we start by sharing our own movements and interactions, starting with Alice, who has been relatively quiet in the discussion so far, and then we can cross-reference our accounts to identify any discrepancies or potential leads.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, can you please share your complete movements since the beginning of the game, as a detailed timeline of everyone's whereabouts is crucial for determining what happened to Charlie?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: To build a reliable timeline, let's start with Alice's movements and then work chronologically through everyone's accounts to identify any inconsistencies.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to emphasize that Alice's continued silence is becoming increasingly suspicious, and I think it's essential that she provides a thorough account of her movements and interactions immediately, as her lack of transparency is starting to raise more questions than answers.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Dave and Bob; a comprehensive timeline of everyone's movements is crucial, and Alice's silence only adds to the urgency of establishing one.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: To create a comprehensive timeline, let's begin with Alice's account of her movements, followed by a chronological review of everyone else's, to identify any inconsistencies.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's time to take a closer look at Erin's alibi, as their claim of being in Weapons the entire game seems suspiciously convenient, and I'd like to ask them to provide more specific details about their tasks and interactions to verify their account.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, given the urgency and the multiple requests, providing a detailed account of your movements is crucial for solving Charlie's death;  a complete timeline is essential to identifying the imposter.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's hear from Alice,

in Medbay and were also seen in the Cafeteria earlier, it seems like they're trying to complete tasks quickly to gain our trust, but it's also possible they're trying to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I've been in Weapons the entire game focusing on tasks, so I can't comment on Charlie's movements, but Dave's observation about their quick task completion warrants further investigation; can Charlie clarify their whereabouts?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I agree with Dave and Erin that Charlie's quick task completion is worth investigating, but let's hear their explanation before making accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given my previous concerns about Charlie's behavior and their untimely death in Medbay, I think it's crucial that we shift our focus to figuring out who might have been responsible, and Erin, your alibi of being in Weapons the entire game seems solid, but can you confirm if you saw or interacted with anyone who might have been heading towards Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I've focused solely on Weapons tasks, making my observations about other areas unreliable, but let's prioritize gathering complete movement accounts from everyone else to build a clearer picture of what happened.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Admin and Storage completing tasks and didn't see Charlie, but a detailed timeline of everyone's movements before the body was reported is essential to finding the imposter.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate the importance of a detailed timeline and propose that we start by sharing our own movements and interactions, starting with Alice, who has been relatively quiet in the discussion so far, and then we can cross-reference our accounts to identify any discrepancies or potential leads.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, can you please share your complete movements since the beginning of the game, as a detailed timeline of everyone's whereabouts is crucial for determining what happened to Charlie?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: To build a reliable timeline, let's start with Alice's movements and then work chronologically through everyone's accounts to identify any inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to emphasize that Alice's continued silence is becoming increasingly suspicious, and I think it's essential that she provides a thorough account of her movements and interactions immediately, as her lack of transparency is starting to raise more questions than answers.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Dave and Bob; a comprehensive timeline of everyone's movements is crucial, and Alice's silence only adds to the urgency of establishing one.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to

I'd like to ask them to provide more specific details about their tasks and interactions to verify their account.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, given the urgency and the multiple requests, providing a detailed account of your movements is crucial for solving Charlie's death;  a complete timeline is essential to identifying the imposter.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to
