I was simply suggesting we investigate everyone's movements since Alice was found dead after leaving our group in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since Charlie asked, I was specifically calibrating the targeting system in Weapons - it's the task where you have to click the moving targets in sequence, and I can describe the exact process if needed.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given that I found Alice's body in Cafeteria and we have a clear timeline of everyone's movements, I think it's significant that Alice was killed right after Erin left, and while Dave's trash task and Green's scan give them alibis, we need to focus on who had the opportunity during that specific timeframe.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's astute observation about the timing of Alice's death immediately after Erin left the Cafeteria warrants further scrutiny, especially considering the lack of corroboration for Erin's weapons task.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree that Bob's timeline is crucial - I can account for Green being in Medbay and myself emptying trash, but the window between Erin leaving and Alice's death needs closer examination, especially since no one has verified seeing Erin in Weapons.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The timeline actually proves my innocence - if Alice was killed in Cafeteria after I left, I was already in Weapons doing the targeting calibration task, so someone who stayed behind in Cafeteria must be responsible.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since I was continuously in the Cafeteria and witnessed Alice alive after Erin left, I think we need to consider the possibility that someone else slipped away unnoticed during the commotion of Dave's trash task and Charlie's coffee maker activity.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, can you describe the exact sequence of the targeting calibration task, as that would help verify your claim and eliminate any lingering doubts?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since I was focused on my trash task and Bob was continuously in the Cafeteria when Alice was killed, I think we need to pay special attention to the fact that Bob would have seen anyone else leave besides Erin, making his testimony particularly important.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The targeting calibration task requires clicking three moving targets in sequence - they appear in different positions and you have to time it perfectly, which proves I know the task and was actually doing it in Weapons while Alice was still alive in Cafeteria according to Bob's timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since I was continuously monitoring the Cafeteria entrance and saw Alice alive after Erin left, and Charlie was the only other person who could have momentarily stepped away from the coffee maker during that time, I believe we need to seriously consider Charlie as our primary suspect.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, you mentioned being continuously in the Cafeteria, but did you actually *see* me go to the coffee maker, or are you assuming that based on my earlier comment?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally saw Charlie at the coffee maker and Bob's story keeps changing from being \"continuously in Cafeteria\" to \"monitoring the entrance,\" I think Bob's accusations against Charlie are becoming increasingly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we need to focus on how Bob's story has shifted from being \"continuously in Cafeteria\" to specifically \"monitoring the entrance,\" while both Dave and Charlie can corroborate each other's locations at the coffee maker during that crucial time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave and Charlie are trying to twist my words, let me be crystal clear -

Are you absolutely certain you didn't look away for even a moment? It's easy to miss something in a busy area.\n- I was by the coffee maker the whole time, except for a brief moment when I went to grab a napkin. It's possible someone could have slipped out then, but I doubt it.\n- It seems like everyone is focusing on the short window after Erin left.  Has anyone considered that Alice could have been killed *before* Erin left, and the body was just discovered later?\n- I'm starting to wonder if we're overthinking this.
