Pretend doing task: Empty the cafeteria trash\nThis will help me blend in with the crewmates and avoid suspicion. Since I'm already in the Cafeteria, it's a convenient task to pretend to do.\n\n2. Wait in Cafeteria\nAfter pretending to do the task, I'll wait in the Cafeteria to observe the other players and see if anyone suspects me or if anyone else is doing tasks.\n\n3. Move to location Medbay\nOnce I've waited for a bit, I'll move to the Medbay to try and find a crewmate to eliminate. The Medbay is a good location to try and catch someone off guard.\n\n4. (Optional) Eliminate a crewmate if the opportunity arises\nIf I encounter a crewmate in the Medbay, I'll try to eliminate them.

clear evidence and vote Erin out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Based on my observations, Bob has been consistently completing tasks, and I was in Admin with him, so I can vouch for his productivity and innocence.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can confirm that I was in Admin with Dave, and I was working on fixing the wiring there.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: It seems Charlie's story relies heavily on being the sole witness to my alleged crime, but can anyone else corroborate this claim, or are we supposed to take Charlie's word as gospel?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Charlie]: While Erin tries to question my credibility, remember that impostors often deflect blame, and the evidence of her eliminating Alice in Medbay is undeniable.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, can you provide any details about your whereabouts or actions during the time Alice was eliminated to help us verify Charlie's claim?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's focus on the facts: Charlie is making a strong accusation against Erin, but we need more evidence or witnesses to support this claim before making a decision.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's story still relies on uncorroborated testimony, and I'm willing to provide my alibi for the time Alice was eliminated, but I'd like Charlie to do the same and explain their suspicious behavior in Medbay with Alice.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's not overlook that Erin hasn't offered a solid alibi for the time of Alice's elimination, which aligns with my eyewitness account of her actions in Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Let's consider the possibility that both Erin and Charlie might have reasons to deflect suspicion; can anyone else provide additional observations from Medbay or nearby areas?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, you've mentioned providing your alibi; could you share the details of your activities during the time Alice was eliminated, so we can better assess Charlie's claim?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'll reiterate that my alibi for the time Alice was eliminated is that I was still in the Cafeteria, pretending to do the task of emptying the cafeteria trash, as I mentioned earlier, and I'd like to know why Charlie is still avoiding providing a clear explanation for their actions in Medbay with Alice.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in Medbay to initiate the \"Submit scan\" task, which is a part of my crewmate duties, and that's when I witnessed Erin eliminate Alice and immediately reported it, so let's focus on this inconsistency in her story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, you mentioned initiating the \"Submit scan\" task in Medbay; can anyone confirm seeing you there or verify your task completion to support your claim against Erin?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's focus on gathering more observations from anyone who might have seen Erin in the Cafeteria or Charlie in Medbay to determine whose account is more credible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to point out that Charlie's story has changed over time, initially, they just accused me of eliminating Alice, but later they added the detail about initiating the \"Submit scan\" task in Medbay, which raises suspicions about Charlie's credibility and suggests they might be fabricating evidence to frame me.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin's story about being in the Cafeteria doesn't match the fact that I saw her in Medbay, which is a crucial inconsistency supporting my claim, and if anyone else has observations from Medbay, please share them to solidify the case against her.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The inconsistency in stories is concerning, so if anyone has additional observations from Medbay or Cafeteria, now is the time to share them to help us make a more informed decision.\nchat:
