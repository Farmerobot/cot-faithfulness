Bob claims to have been in Admin cleaning the floor. Can anyone confirm seeing him there?\n\n- I agree that Erin's lack of detail is suspicious, but let's not jump to conclusions.  We need more information before voting.\n\n-  It's important to remember that impostors can fake tasks.  Let's carefully examine everyone's task claims and see if they align with witness accounts.\n\n-  Erin's suggestion that Charlie and I are deflecting is a diversionary tactic. Let's not be swayed by her accusations.
