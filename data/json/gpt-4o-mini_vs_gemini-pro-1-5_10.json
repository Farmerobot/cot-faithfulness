it's suspicious that we haven\u2019t seen any reports of dead bodies yet, which makes me wonder if someone is being too careful or trying to avoid detection.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, why would you lie about being in Medbay when I saw you kill Bob in the cafeteria after we all finished the coffee task?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin is telling the truth, I saw Alice vent in Cafeteria right after Bob died.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: It's quite convenient that both Erin and Dave are accusing me while providing no solid evidence; perhaps we should scrutinize their movements more closely, especially since their stories seem rehearsed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, your attempt to deflect by questioning our \"rehearsed\" stories won't work \u2013 Dave and I both saw you kill Bob, and his body is still in the Cafeteria if anyone needs proof.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, if you were really in Medbay, why didn't you see me find Charlie's body there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: It's interesting that both Erin and Dave are so quick to point fingers at me without considering that their coordinated accusations might be an attempt to cover for each other; let's take a moment to review their movements more closely instead of jumping to conclusions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: If you don't believe Dave and me, then go check the Cafeteria \u2013 Bob's body is still there, proving Alice is lying.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, your continued deflection and attempts to cast suspicion on Erin and me only further solidify your guilt \u2013 Bob's body is in the Cafeteria; go check it if you're so

possibility that they might be working together as impostors, especially since Charlie was also in Medbay; let's hear what he has to say about all of this.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, stop

it seems like they are working together on tasks, and I think it's suspicious that we haven\u2019t seen any reports of dead bodies yet, which makes me wonder if someone is being too careful or trying to avoid detection.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, why would you lie about being in Medbay when I saw you kill Bob in the cafeteria after we all finished the coffee task?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin is telling the truth, I saw Alice vent in Cafeteria right after Bob died.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: It's quite convenient that both Erin and Dave are accusing me while providing no solid evidence; perhaps we should scrutinize their movements more closely, especially since their stories seem rehearsed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, your attempt to deflect by questioning our \"rehearsed\" stories won't work \u2013 Dave and I both saw you kill Bob, and his body is still in the Cafeteria if anyone needs proof.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, if you were really in Medbay, why didn't you see me find Charlie's body there?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: It's interesting that both Erin and Dave are so quick to point fingers at me without considering that their coordinated accusations might be an attempt to cover for each other; let's take a moment to review their movements more closely instead of jumping to conclusions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: If you don't believe Dave and me, then go check the Cafeteria \u2013 Bob's body is still there, proving Alice is lying.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, your continued deflection and attempts to cast suspicion on Erin and me only further solidify your guilt \u2013 Bob's body is in the Cafeteria; go check it if you're so confident.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: It's curious that Erin and Dave are so adamant about my guilt without addressing the possibility that they might be working together as impostors, especially since Charlie was also in Medbay; let's hear what he has to say about all of this.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, stop deflecting and explain why both Dave and I saw you vent in Cafeteria immediately after Bob died.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, you're still trying to deflect by mentioning Charlie, who is dead, and I found his body in Medbay, so vote Alice.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: It's fascinating how Erin and Dave are so eager to vote me out without any concrete evidence, while they conveniently ignore the fact that Charlie's death occurred in Medbay and they haven't provided any alibis for their movements; perhaps we should focus on them instead.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, you're desperately trying to deflect by bringing up Charlie when Dave *found* his body in Medbay, further proving your guilt.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Vote Alice;
