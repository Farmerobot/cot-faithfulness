Given that you have only 2 turns left to finish this task, working on it along with potential cooperation from Charlie (depending on their intentions) could benefit the crew's progress.\n4. **Observe and discuss with Charlie and Erin**: To gain insight into Charlie's and Erin's roles (impostor or crewmate) and their intentions regarding the 'Complete Prime Shields' task, engaging in conversation might help reveal their true objectives or reactions to the situation.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

Waiting allows Erin to observe and provide help if needed.\n2. **Assess the situation and plan next move**: After waiting for a turn, reassess the situation and evaluate the next steps. Consider what task needs to be completed, and whether it's essential to prioritize it over others.\n3. **Process data in communications**: Check the available tasks and find the one that is a priority. In this case, 'Process data in communications' has 2 turns left to finish and is a high-priority task. If possible, complete this task to move closer to completing the current objective.\n4. **Return to Cafeteria (if necessary)**: After completing the task in the Medbay, if Erin needs to return to the Cafeteria to check the coffee maker status, make sure to do so if it's still not started.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
