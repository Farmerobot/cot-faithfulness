deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nHere are some discussion points as Dave, a Crewmate:\n\n- It's becoming increasingly clear that Bob's alibis and stories about his

last saw them, which directly contradicts Bob's claim that he didn't see Charlie leave Medbay.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: Based on the role and discussion points provided, but without any recent player messages shown to respond to, I'll create a message that establishes presence and creates subtle suspicion:\n\nI've been doing my tasks in Medbay and noticed Bob moving suspiciously between rooms - has anyone else seen this pattern?\n[Alice]: I think it's worth investigating Bob's movements further, as it's unusual for someone to be moving between rooms so frequently, especially considering the recent elimination of Charlie, and I'd like to propose that we keep a closer eye on Bob's activities to ensure everyone's safety.\n[Dave]: Given the recent elimination of Charlie and

Charlie's elimination, as it seems like his story might not entirely add up.\n[Bob]: I'm happy to provide a detailed account of my actions and whereabouts in Medbay around the time of Charlie's elimination: I was working on my tasks alongside Alice and Erin, and we were taking a short break when Erin mentioned seeing Charlie doing diagnostics, but I didn't see Charlie leave Medbay or interact with anyone after that point, and our conversation was interrupted by someone calling for help in Oxygen Generator, which is a room I had been preparing to visit next.\n[Erin]: That's

He should submit the scan in Medbay to make progress on the objectives and help the crew complete the Medbay tasks.\n4. **Gather information from Erin**: Since Erin's statement about Charlie being alive and doing diagnostics when she last saw them directly contradicts Bob's claim, Dave should gather more information from Erin about her interactions with Charlie and the circumstances surrounding Charlie's discovery.

This will help him make progress on the tasks and bring the crew closer to completing the objectives.\n4. **Observe and discuss with Erin and Bob**: While working in Medbay, Dave should observe Erin and Bob's actions and behaviors. He can discuss the current situation and tasks with them to gather more information and identify any potential impostors.\n\nThis plan prioritizes completing the Medbay tasks, which are crucial for the crew's progress.

in Medbay, especially since it has two turns left to finish. Moving to Medbay will allow Dave to start working on the tasks there.\n2. **Run diagnostics in Medbay**: Once in Medbay, Dave should run diagnostics to start making progress on the tasks. This action will also give him a better understanding of the current state of the tasks and the resources needed to complete them.\n3. **Submit scan in Medbay**: After running diagnostics, Dave should submit the scan in Medbay. This will help him make progress on the tasks and bring the crew closer to completing the objectives.\n4. **Observe and discuss with Erin and Bob**: While working in Medbay, Dave should observe Erin and Bob's actions and behaviors. He can discuss the current situation and tasks with them to gather more information and identify any potential impostors.\n\nThis plan prioritizes completing the Medbay tasks, which are crucial for the crew's progress. By working on these tasks, Dave can contribute to the crew's objectives and gain valuable information about the impostors' intentions.\nYour action: move to location medbay\nObservations:\nDead players found: Charlie\nVoting phase has started.

Given the situation, this task takes priority over moving to other rooms or engaging in discussions.\n2. **Observe Erin's actions and behaviors**: As Dave is the only crewmate left in Medbay, he should observe Erin's actions and behaviors closely. This will help him determine whether Erin is a trustworthy crewmate or an impostor.\n3. **Prepare for potential elimination**: Given the recent elimination of Bob and the suspicious behavior displayed by Erin, Dave should prepare for the possibility of being eliminated next. This involves being aware of Erin's actions and being ready to provide information about his own actions and whereabouts during the game.\n4. **Consider moving to Upper Engine or Cafeteria after completing the task**: Once the task in Medbay is completed, Dave should consider moving to other rooms to gather more information and complete other tasks.

statement that Charlie was alive and doing diagnostics when she last saw them directly contradicts Bob's claim that he didn't see Charlie leave Medbay, and his inconsistent alibis and suspicious

other crew members to help clear up any doubts, but I also think it's essential that we focus on finding the truth about Charlie's elimination and the suspicious movements of some crew members, rather than jumping to conclusions or making accusations, and I'd like to propose that we work together to investigate the Oxygen Generator room, as it seems like someone called for help there, and it might
