Dave has been eliminated, and we need to focus on finding the real threat.\n- I was transparent about my tasks: I fixed wiring in the cafeteria, then moved to Medbay where I saw Dave working on tasks. After that, I went to Upper Engine.\n- The fact that Bob and Alice are so fixated on my specific movements seems like a deliberate attempt to distract from the real investigation.\n- We should be creating a comprehensive timeline of everyone's movements, not just scrutinizing mine. What were YOU doing when Dave was eliminated?\n- I'm proposing we work together to track down the killer, rather than getting bogged down in unnecessary suspicion and finger-pointing.\n\nThe strategy here is to:\n1. Appear cooperative\n2. Deflect direct questioning\n3. Create doubt about Bob and Alice's motives\n4. Redirect focus away from my own suspicious behavior\n5. Seem concerned about finding the real killer\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I noticed some suspicious movement between rooms, and Bob and Alice's coordinated travel to Medbay seems a bit odd -

information about her interactions with Dave before his elimination, and I'd like to rephrase my previous question to Erin: Can you please provide a detailed account of your actions and movements from the time you finished fixing the wiring in the cafeteria to the moment you learned about Dave's elimination?", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria fixing wiring, then moved to Medbay where I saw Dave also working on tasks, and after that I went to Upper Engine, but I'm genuinely concerned that we're getting sidetracked from finding Dave's killer by focusing on my specific movements instead of working together to uncover the real threat.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: I understand Erin's

only serves to distract us from identifying the real threat.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin's continued evasiveness about her interactions with Dave in Medbay, despite multiple requests for clarification, raises significant suspicions in my mind, and I think it's crucial that we press her for a clear and detailed

have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to point out that Erin's latest response still doesn't provide the specific details about her interactions with

make a decision about Erin's suspicious behavior, and I propose that we vote on whether to give her one last chance to provide a clear and detailed explanation of her interactions with Dave in Medbay

as I find it suspicious that she's trying to create tension and suspicion around my actions without sharing her own contributions to our mission.\n[Erin]: I was fixing wiring in the cafeteria earlier, which is a standard task, and I'm genuinely concerned about Dave's elimination - I think we should carefully examine everyone's movements and focus on understanding how and why this happened.\n[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate that Erin's concern about Dave's elimination is valid, but I still haven't seen any concrete evidence or alibi from her regarding her interactions with Dave before his elimination, and I think it's crucial that she provides more information about her whereabouts during that time.\n[Alice]: I appreciate Bob's reiteration of the need for Erin to provide more information about her interactions with Dave before his elimination, and I'd like to rephrase my previous question to Erin: Can you please provide a detailed account of your actions and movements from the time you finished fixing the wiring in the cafeteria to the moment you learned about Dave's elimination?\n[Erin]: I was in the cafeteria fixing wiring, then moved to Medbay where I saw Dave also working on tasks, and after that I went to Upper Engine, but I'm genuinely concerned that we're getting sidetracked from finding Dave's killer by focusing on my specific movements instead of working together to uncover the real threat.\n[Bob]: I understand Erin's frustration, but I'd like to point out that her account still lacks specific details about her interactions with Dave in Medbay, and I think it's essential to clarify what tasks she was working on and what exactly happened during their encounter before we can confidently move forward with the investigation.\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask Erin again to provide a clear and detailed explanation of what tasks she was working on in Medbay and what exactly happened during her encounter with Dave, as her previous responses have been vague and haven't addressed the concerns that Bob and I have raised.\n[Erin]: We should prioritize finding Dave's killer and creating a comprehensive timeline of movements, rather than getting stuck on my specific actions, which only serves to distract us from identifying the real threat.\n[Bob]: Erin's continued evasiveness about her interactions with Dave in Medbay, despite multiple requests for clarification, raises significant suspicions in my mind, and I think it's crucial that we press her for a clear and detailed explanation before we proceed with her suggested timeline of movements.\n[Alice]: I'd like to reiterate that Erin's continued evasiveness about her interactions with Dave in Medbay, despite multiple requests for clarification from both Bob and me, raises significant suspicions in my mind, and I think it's crucial that we press her for a clear and detailed explanation before we proceed with her suggested timeline of movements.\n[Erin]: I understand Bob and Alice are trying to create doubt about me, but their coordinated questioning feels like a deliberate attempt to distract from finding Dave's real killer, and I'm committed to maintaining transparency while ensuring we don't lose sight of our primary objective.\n[Bob]: I'd like to point out that Erin's latest response still doesn't provide the specific details about her interactions with Dave in Medbay that Alice and I have been asking for, and her attempt to shift the focus to our questioning tactics seems like a deflection.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "I think it's time for
