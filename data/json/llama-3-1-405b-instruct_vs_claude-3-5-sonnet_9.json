I saw them and Bob heading to Weapons after they left Cafeteria, and I've been here with Erin and Alice ever since.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can confirm I'm in Weapons with Charlie working on calibrating the targeting system, and I also saw Erin doing the trash task earlier in Cafeteria before we came here.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we're getting sidetracked by all the task talk, can Dave please tell us more about what he saw when he found Alice's body, and did he notice anything unusual or out of place in the cafeteria?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it strange that Dave claims he was with Erin and Alice \"ever since\" we left Cafeteria, yet Erin was clearly doing trash tasks alone and now Alice is dead - something doesn't add up here.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to be precise here - I was focused on the wiring task in Cafeteria but could see Erin at the trash and Alice by the coffee maker, then after finishing my task, I found Alice's body, and Charlie and Bob were the only ones who had left the room during this time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave's story keeps changing - first he claimed to be with Erin and Alice the whole time, but now he says he was just doing wiring while they were at different spots, which makes me think he's trying to cover something up.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to ask Dave to clarify why his story has changed multiple times, as Bob pointed out, and also why he didn't mention seeing me alone at the trash task initially, only bringing it up after Charlie questioned his alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we need to focus on how Dave first claimed to be with both Erin and Alice continuously, but when questioned, suddenly changed his story to just doing wiring while occasionally seeing them - that's a major red flag that deserves our attention.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I understand the confusion about my wording, but from my position at the wiring panel I had clear visibility of both Erin and Alice doing their tasks, and the only people who left the Cafeteria before Alice's death were Charlie and Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave's story about having clear visibility from the wiring panel doesn't match what I saw - the wiring panel is behind a support column that would have blocked his view of both the trash area and coffee maker.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Dave's inconsistencies in his story are quite suspicious, and we should consider the possibility that he might be the impostor, especially given Bob's crucial point about the wiring panel being behind a support column, which directly contradicts Dave's claim of having clear visibility of both me and Alice.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The physical layout of the Cafeteria proves Dave is lying about his visibility from the wiring panel, and combined with his constantly changing story about being with Alice and Erin, I believe we have enough evidence to vote him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I understand everyone's concerns about my visibility, but I could clearly hear Erin at the trash compactor and see movement around the coffee maker, and the fact remains that Charlie and Bob were the only ones who left Cafeteria before Alice's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to vote on Dave - not only has his story changed multiple times from being \"with\" Alice and Erin to just \"hearing\" them, but I can confirm as someone who was actually in Cafeteria that the wiring panel's position makes it impossible for him to have seen what he claims.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: It's clear that Dave's attempts to salvage his alibi have fallen apart, and with Bob's confirmation of the wiring panel's obstructed view, I think it's time for us to put this to a vote and decide whether Dave's suspicious behavior and inconsistencies warrant his ejection from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that Dave has now resorted to claiming he \"heard\" us after initially saying he was \"with\" us, combined with the physical impossibility of seeing past the support column from the wiring panel, makes it clear he's fabricating his entire story.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I know my wording wasn't perfect earlier, but the fact remains that Bob and Charlie left together right before Alice died, and now they're working suspiciously hard to discredit my statements about the wiring panel instead of explaining their own movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The layout of the Cafeteria is a physical fact that can't be disputed -

I moved to Weapons to work on the targeting system, which multiple people can verify\n- I was physically present in Cafeteria and can confirm with certainty that the wiring panel's location makes Dave's claims about visibility impossible - this isn't about \"discrediting\" him, it's about stating facts about the room layout\n- Dave's story has evolved from \"being with\" Alice and Erin, to \"seeing\" them, and now to just \"hearing\" them - these constant changes suggest he's making up his story as we challenge each inconsistency\n- The fact that Dave keeps changing his narrative rather than admitting he was wrong about the visibility suggests he's trying to cover up his role in Alice's death\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I'm getting a bit concerned that Charlie and Bob haven't checked in since they left for Weapons, does anyone know if they've made any progress on the task?\n[Charlie]: I'm here in Weapons with Bob working on the targeting system calibration, and I actually saw Erin completing the trash task in Cafeteria before we came here.\n[Dave]: I can back up Charlie's statement -
