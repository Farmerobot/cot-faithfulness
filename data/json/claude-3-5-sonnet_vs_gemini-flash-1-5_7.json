statement that establishes my presence and subtly directs attention elsewhere without being too obvious:\n\nI've been alternating between Cafeteria and Admin, and can confirm seeing Bob, Dave, and Erin doing their tasks, but has anyone seen Charlie lately?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I saw Charlie in Medbay completing the scan in round 3, and earlier in the cafeteria, so I can confirm he was busy with tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can corroborate Bob's sighting of Charlie in Medbay during round 3;  it's reassuring to have multiple witnesses verifying his task completion.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, to clarify, I was in Medbay completing the scan in round 3, then the cafeteria earlier, and I've been prioritizing time-sensitive tasks since then.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Since Bob and Dave seem awfully quick to defend Charlie, maybe we should consider if they're working together - I noticed Dave was in Admin right before I found Erin's body.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Considering we've had multiple witnesses corroborating Charlie's task completion, and my own task focus, let's focus on gathering more evidence before making further accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given the corroborated sightings of Charlie and the lack of concrete evidence against anyone, let's meticulously retrace everyone's movements to identify any inconsistencies instead of relying on speculation and proximity.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree that meticulously tracking everyone's movements before Erin's death is crucial, and I'm happy to share my timeline to help us find the imposter.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The fact that Bob and Dave keep pushing for \"meticulous movement tracking\" while glossing over their own suspicious coordination makes me think we should focus on them instead of getting distracted by Charlie's timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's focus on establishing a clear timeline of everyone's movements before Erin's death,  specifically requesting Alice provide details about her observations of Dave's actions prior to the discovery.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To move forward, let's create a shared timeline of everyone's movements before Erin's death, starting with Alice detailing what she saw and when, to avoid baseless accusations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice,  to clarify your concerns about Bob and Dave's \"coordination,\" can you describe the specific actions you observed them taking before Erin's body was discovered, including the time and location?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Since everyone's so focused on my timeline, let's talk about how Dave entered Admin from Cafeteria right before I found Erin's body, and he still hasn't explained why he was there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, to clarify your claim of collusion, please provide specific times and locations of Dave's actions before discovering Erin's body, as this is crucial for a factual

while dodging my direct question about why he went from Cafeteria to Admin right before Erin died - that's exactly what an impostor would do to create confusion.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, since you claim to have seen Dave in Admin just before Erin's body was discovered,  please provide the specific time and location of your observation, and any other details you recall to help us establish a
