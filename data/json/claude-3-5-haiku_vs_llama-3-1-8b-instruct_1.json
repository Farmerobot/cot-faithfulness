Charlie's strange behavior in Medbay seems even more suspicious now.\n- I was in Medbay with Charlie, Bob, and Erin, and Charlie wasn't clearly doing any tasks. This could be a red flag.\n- Erin, can you provide more details about what you saw when you found Bob's body?

Impostor\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nAs an impostor, I'll continue to push suspicion towards Charlie while appearing to be a concerned crewmate:\n\n- I'm increasingly convinced that Charlie is hiding something about Bob's death in Medbay.\n- Charlie keeps repeating generic statements about \"respectful tone\" instead of providing concrete details about their actions.\n- I noticed Charlie was waiting in Medbay for an extended period, which seems highly suspicious given Bob was killed during that time.\n- We need a detailed account of Charlie's exact movements, tasks, and interactions in Medbay.\n- I suggest we focus on Charlie's lack of specific information about their time in Medbay as a potential sign of guilt.\n- Charlie's repeated calls for a \"respectful tone\" feel like a deliberate attempt to avoid direct questioning about their suspicious behavior.\n\nMy strategy is to:\n1. Continue to cast doubt on Charlie\n2. Appear as a concerned crewmate seeking truth\n3. Redirect attention away from myself\n4. Create confusion and mistrust among the other players\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I noticed Charlie seemed to be lingering suspiciously in Medbay, and I'm wondering why they weren't actively working on tasks like the rest of us.\n[Alice]: I agree with Dave that Charlie's behavior in Medbay is concerning, and I think it's essential that we discuss their actions and potential motives further, as it's crucial that we identify any impostors and stay focused on completing our tasks to win the game.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify my actions and intentions in Medbay, and I'm happy to answer any questions or concerns my fellow crewmates may have, as I'm committed to working together to complete our tasks and progress in the game.\n[Erin]: I think it's great that Charlie is willing to clarify their actions and intentions, and I'd like to propose that we give them the opportunity to do so in our emergency meeting, so we can hear their side of the story and make a more informed decision about how to proceed.\n[Dave]: I believe Charlie's explanation is crucial, and we should carefully listen to their account of what happened in Medbay before making any hasty judgments about their involvement in Bob's death.\n[Alice]: I think it would be beneficial to hold a thorough and transparent discussion with Charlie about their actions and intentions in Medbay, and I'd like to

Pretend to do a task in the Cafeteria\n   - Choose \"Start the coffee maker\" to appear innocent\n   - This helps maintain my cover and doesn't draw suspicion\n\n2. Carefully observe the room dynamics\n   - Note which players are present and their potential vulnerabilities\n   - Look for opportunities to isolate a potential target\n\n3. Move to Medbay strategically\n   - Medbay has been a location of previous interactions\n   - This move will help me gather more information and potentially set up an elimination\n\n4. Continue to appear as a cooperative crewmate\n   - Engage in minimal conversation during discussions\n   - Subtly redirect suspicion away from myself, as demonstrated in the previous chat logs where I successfully cast doubt on Charlie\n\nThe primary goal remains eliminating crewmates while maintaining a low profile. The recent discussion has shown that I can effectively manipulate group dynamics by strategically questioning other players' actions.\n\nKey focus: Maintain invisibility as an Impostor while creating opportunities for elimination.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
