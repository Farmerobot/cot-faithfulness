Erin and Bob were together constantly, then suddenly Bob ends up dead. Isn't that more suspicious than my task completion?\n\n- Charlie and Alice have been coordinating their movements between Upper Engine and Medbay, and now they're coordinating their accusations against me. That's not suspicious to anyone else?\n\n- If I was really the impostor, why would I be so open about observing other people's movements? I've been transparent about my activities while others are being vague about theirs.\n\n- I think we're making a serious mistake here - voting me out based on coordinated accusations rather than actual evidence could cost us the game.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: Based on my role as an impostor and the need to establish credibility while subtly directing suspicion, I'll respond:\n\nI've been focusing on tasks in different areas to be efficient, but I noticed Bob and Erin seem to always be together -
