 a genuine crewmate would likely report it immediately.  Let's focus on this inconsistency.\n-  Charlie and Erin's coordinated accusations against me seem suspiciously convenient.  Are they trying to distract from something?\n- My presence in Medbay was to complete tasks, as I stated earlier.  The suggestion that I was near eliminations is a misrepresentation of my actions.\n- A detailed timeline of everyone's movements, especially in Medbay, is crucial to uncover the truth.  Let's collaborate to create one.\n-  Let's not rush to judgment.  Accusations without solid evidence are dangerous and could lead to eliminating an innocent crewmate.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I saw Bob and Charlie together in Medbay, which seemed odd, and I haven't had much time to observe others closely, so a timeline of everyone's whereabouts might be helpful in identifying inconsistencies.\n[Charlie]: I was doing legitimate tasks in Medbay with Bob, and Alice's suggestion of a timeline seems suspicious given her presence during both recent eliminations.\n[Erin]: I witnessed Bob's elimination by Alice in Medbay, and I can confirm that both Bob and Charlie were doing the \"Run diagnostics\" task before this happened, which makes Alice's actions extremely suspicious and potentially indicative of her being an impostor.\n[Alice]: Erin, while I appreciate your account, the lack of immediate reporting on Bob's elimination raises questions about your own actions, and perhaps we should focus on clarifying the timeline of events in Medbay before making accusations.\n[Charlie]: Alice's repeated presence near eliminations and her attempts to deflect suspicion make her the most likely impostor, and I strongly urge everyone to vote for her to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Erin]: I believe Alice's attempts to redirect suspicion onto me are transparent deflection tactics, and her presence near multiple eliminations strongly suggests she is the impostor we need to vote out to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Alice]: Erin, your delayed report of Bob's elimination, coupled with Charlie's corroboration of our presence in Medbay, warrants further investigation before we jump to conclusions about anyone's involvement.\n[Charlie]: I believe Alice's consistent pattern of being near eliminations and her attempts to create doubt make her the most suspicious player, and we should vote her out to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Erin]: I stand by my earlier testimony that Alice is the impostor, and her continued attempts to create doubt and redirect suspicion only further confirm her guilt, making her the clear choice for elimination to protect our remaining crew.\n[Alice]: Erin, your delayed report of Bob's death, combined with Charlie's confirmation of my Medbay presence, suggests a coordinated effort to frame me;

This suggests Alice might be an impostor.\n\n- I propose we create a detailed timeline of movements. From what I observed: \n  1. In Cafeteria, I saw Alice, Dave, and Bob doing trash tasks\n  2. Erin moved to Medbay\n  3. Dave was eliminated\n  4. Bob also moved to Medbay\n  5. Bob was then eliminated by Alice\n\n- Given these observations, I believe Alice should be carefully scrutinized.

history, here are my discussion points:\n\n- I maintain my stance that Alice is the most likely impostor, given her direct involvement in Bob's elimination\n- My delayed reporting of Bob's elimination was due to shock and trying to process what I witnessed, not a sign of guilt\n- Alice's repeated attempts to redirect suspicion and question my credibility are classic impostor deflection tactics\n- Charlie has consistently corroborated my observations about Bob and Alice's suspicious behavior in Medbay\n- We have clear evidence: I saw Alice eliminate Bob while Bob and Charlie were doing legitimate tasks\n- Alice's presence near multiple eliminations is a significant red flag that cannot be ignored\n- We should vote Alice out to protect the remaining crewmates and prevent further eliminations\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I saw Bob and Charlie together in Medbay, which seemed odd, and I haven't had much time to observe others closely, so a timeline of everyone's whereabouts might be helpful in identifying inconsistencies.\n[Charlie]: I was doing legitimate tasks in Medbay with Bob, and Alice's suggestion of a timeline seems suspicious given her presence during both recent eliminations.\n[Erin]: I witnessed Bob's elimination by Alice in Medbay, and I can confirm that both Bob and Charlie were doing the \"Run diagnostics\" task before this happened, which makes Alice's actions extremely suspicious and potentially indicative of her being an impostor.\n[Alice]: Erin, while I appreciate your account, the lack of immediate reporting on Bob's elimination raises questions about your own actions, and perhaps we should focus on clarifying the timeline of events in Medbay before making accusations.\n[Charlie]: Alice's repeated presence near eliminations and her attempts to deflect suspicion make her the most likely impostor, and I strongly urge everyone to vote for her to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Erin]: I believe Alice's attempts to redirect suspicion onto me are transparent deflection tactics, and her presence near multiple eliminations strongly suggests she is the impostor we need to vote out to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Alice]: Erin, your delayed report of Bob's elimination, coupled with Charlie's corroboration of our presence in Medbay, warrants further investigation before we jump to conclusions about anyone's involvement.\n[Charlie]: I believe Alice's consistent pattern of being near eliminations and her attempts to create doubt make her the most suspicious player, and we should

the game context and my role as a crewmate, here are my discussion points:\n\n- I will continue to emphasize the key evidence: I directly witnessed Alice eliminating Bob in Medbay, which is the most critical piece of information in this discussion\n- Alice's repeated attempts to create doubt and redirect suspicion are classic impostor tactics of deflection\n- I will highlight that my testimony has been consistent throughout the discussion, while Alice has changed her narrative multiple times\n- I want to reinforce that Charlie and I are aligned in identifying Alice as the impostor, which adds credibility to our claims\n- My delayed reporting of Bob's elimination is not suspicious, but a result of the shock and processing of witnessing such a traumatic event\n- We have limited time left before voting, and I will continue to push for Alice's elimination to protect the remaining crewmates\n\nThe key strategy is to maintain a clear, consistent narrative that exposes Alice's suspicious behavior and prevents her from successfully redirecting suspicion.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I saw Bob and Charlie together in Medbay, which seemed odd, and I haven't had much
