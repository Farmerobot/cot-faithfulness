[Erin]: I just want to remind everyone that while we were all together in Medbay, Bob was moving around a lot earlier, and now he's gone to Upper Engine alone, which seems a bit suspicious\u2014has anyone seen him since?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Medbay earlier with multiple witnesses, and my movements have been transparent\u2014I'm methodically completing tasks, and Alice can confirm I was with her in Medbay before heading to Upper Engine to continue my work.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Erin eliminate Alice in Medbay, and I can confidently state that Erin is an impostor who must be voted out immediately to protect the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can confirm Dave's statement about Erin eliminating Alice, as I personally witnessed the incident in Medbay and believe Erin should be voted out immediately to protect the remaining crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: It's curious that both Dave and Charlie are so quick to accuse me; perhaps they're trying to deflect attention from themselves, especially since Bob's movements to Upper Engine after being with Alice in Medbay seem suspicious as well.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I stand by my previous statement and urge everyone to recognize the coordinated attempt by Erin to redirect suspicion away from her, especially given Dave and Charlie's direct eyewitness account of her eliminating Alice in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin's attempt to cast doubt on Bob is a clear deflection tactic, and both Charlie and I can confirm she eliminated Alice in Medbay, so we must vote her out to protect the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I strongly support Dave's and Bob's points, and I reiterate that Erin's elimination of Alice in Medbay is a clear indication of her being an impostor, and we must vote her out to protect the remaining crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: It's quite telling that both Dave and Charlie have such a united front against me, which raises the question of whether they're trying to eliminate me to cover for each other; shouldn't we consider the possibility that they might be working together?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I firmly believe Erin is attempting to create confusion and deflect attention from her confirmed elimination of Alice, and we must vote her out to protect the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We have clear, consistent testimony from both Charlie and myself that Erin eliminated Alice in Medbay, and her continued attempts to redirect suspicion only further confirm her guilt as an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I want to emphasize that Dave and I have provided direct, consistent eyewitness testimony of Erin eliminating Alice in Medbay, and her attempts to create doubt and redirect suspicion are classic impostor tactics that should not distract us from the clear evidence of her guilt.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: It's interesting how both Dave and Charlie are so adamant about my guilt, perhaps they are trying to cover for each other, especially since Bob's movements to Upper Engine seem unaccounted for; we should really consider the possibility that they are the ones working together to eliminate me.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I challenge Erin to provide concrete evidence of her innocence, as Dave, Charlie, and I have consistently testified to her elimination of Alice in Medbay, and her continued attempts to create doubt only further confirm her guilt as an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I stand by my previous statement that Erin's elimination of Alice in Medbay is an undeniable fact, and her repeated attempts to redirect suspicion only serve to confirm her guilt as an impostor who must be voted out to protect the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I want to reiterate that Dave and I have provided consistent, direct eyewitness testimony of Erin eliminating Alice in Medbay, and her continued attempts to deflect and create confusion only further prove her guilt as an impostor who must be voted out to protect the remaining crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: It's fascinating how both Dave and Charlie are so united in their accusations against me, yet Bob's unexplained movements to Upper Engine could very well be a cover for his own actions, so shouldn't we investigate that further instead of jumping to conclusions?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I challenge Erin to stop her baseless deflection tactics and address the direct eyewitness testimony from Dave and Charlie about her eliminating Alice in Medbay, which clearly demonstrates her guilt as an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We have irrefutable evidence from both Charlie and myself that Erin eliminated Alice in Medbay, and her continued attempts to redirect suspicion only further confirm her guilt as an impostor who must be voted out to protect the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I want to definitively emphasize that Dave and I have provided direct, consistent eyewitness testimony of Erin eliminating Alice

the possibility that Bob's movements to Upper Engine might be a cover-up for his own actions; he could be trying to shift suspicion away from himself.\n- I suggest we take a moment to review
