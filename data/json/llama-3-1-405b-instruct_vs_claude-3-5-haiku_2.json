Engine, which is extremely suspicious despite their friendly task-oriented message, and I strongly believe we should vote Charlie out to protect the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can confirm Alice's accusation and witnessed Charlie eliminating Erin in the Medbay, so we must vote Charlie out to prevent further eliminations of crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in the Medbay during the incident, and I fully support Alice and Bob's claims that Charlie eliminated Erin, so we must vote Charlie out to protect our remaining team members.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to address the accusations made by Alice, Bob, and Dave, and I must say that I'm shocked and disappointed by their claims, especially since I was in the Medbay with all of them and didn't see anyone leave or enter the room, which makes me wonder if they're trying to deflect attention from themselves.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I will vote to eject Charlie because Bob, Dave, and I have directly witnessed his elimination of Erin, and his attempt to cast doubt on our consistent testimony is a clear sign of an impostor trying to manipulate the discussion and avoid being voted out.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I am absolutely certain that Charlie is the impostor, and we must vote them out immediately to prevent any further eliminations of our crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I stand firmly by my previous statement and Alice and Bob's testimony - Charlie's attempt to deflect and create confusion only further confirms that they are the impostor, and we must vote them out to protect our remaining team members.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It's quite telling that Alice, Bob, and Dave are so adamant about voting me out without providing any concrete evidence to support their claims, and I'd like to ask them to clarify the discrepancies in their testimonies, specifically why they initially claimed to have witnessed the incident in different locations, Upper Engine and Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I stand by my original testimony that Charlie eliminated Erin in Upper Engine, and Charlie's attempts to create confusion about location details only further prove their guilt as an impostor trying to

elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I will continue to emphasize the consistent testimony from Alice, Bob, and myself, and highlight that Charlie's attempts to create doubt only further confirm their guilt as an impostor who eliminated Erin, making it crucial that we vote Charlie out to protect our remaining team members.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to point out that Alice, Bob, and Dave's testimonies are still inconsistent, as Alice claims the incident occurred in Upper Engine, while Bob and Dave claim it was in Medbay, and I urge the group to consider the possibility that they may be coordinating their efforts to frame me, rather than providing genuine eyewitness accounts.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I will continue to firmly assert that Charlie eliminated Erin in Upper Engine, and the inconsistency Charlie points out is merely a desperate attempt to create doubt, as the core fact remains that all three of us witnessed Charlie's elimination of Erin, making it crucial that we vote Charlie out to protect our remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I will continue to firmly assert that Charlie eliminated Erin in Medbay, and the location discrepancy is irrelevant compared to the consistent testimony from Alice, Dave, and myself that Charlie is the impostor who must be voted out to protect our remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I will continue to emphasize the consistent testimony from Alice, Bob, and myself that Charlie eliminated Erin, and the minor location discrepancy does not change the core fact that Charlie must be voted out to protect our remaining crewmates from further elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you

I've been focusing on emptying the cafeteria trash, making sure our living quarters are clean and tidy.\n- I noticed Alice moved to Upper Engine from Medbay. Does anyone know what task she's working on there? Maybe we can offer some assistance.\n- Bob, you've been waiting in Medbay for a while.

be trying to deflect attention from themselves.\n- I'd like to ask Alice, Bob, and Dave to provide more evidence or clarify their alibis during the time of the incident, as I believe their accusations are unfounded and misleading.\n- I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions based on hearsay, and instead, focus on gathering more information and evidence before making any decisions.\n- I'm willing to cooperate and help the team investigate the incident, and I hope that we can work together to find the real culprit behind Erin's elimination.", "I'd like to address the

are unfounded and misleading.\n- I think we should be cautious and not jump to conclusions based on hearsay, and instead, focus on gathering more information and evidence before making any

discussion history and my observations as Alice (a crewmate), here are my discussion points:\n\n- I will maintain my consistent testimony that Charlie eliminated Erin in Upper Engine, which is a critical fact regardless of the minor location discrepancy.\n- The key point is that all three of us (Alice, Bob, and Dave) witnessed Charlie eliminating Erin, which is strong evidence of Charlie being an impostor.\n- Charlie's attempts to create doubt by focusing on location inconsistencies are a typical impostor tactic to avoid being voted out.\n- I emphasize that the core truth remains: Charlie eliminated Erin, and we must protect the remaining crewmates by voting Charlie out.\n- I call on the other players to focus on the fundamental evidence: Charlie was directly observed eliminating another player, which is clear proof of being an impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I'd like to start by saying that I've been focusing on emptying the cafeteria trash,

have directly witnessed his elimination of Erin, and his attempt to cast doubt on our consistent testimony is a clear sign of an impostor trying to manipulate the discussion and avoid being voted out.\n[Bob]: I am absolutely certain that Charlie is the impostor, and we must vote them out immediately to prevent any further eliminations of our crewmates.\n[Dave]: I stand firmly by my previous statement and Alice and Bob's testimony - Charlie's attempt to deflect and create confusion only further confirms that they are the impostor, and we must vote them out to protect our remaining team

clarify the discrepancies in their testimonies, specifically why they initially claimed to have witnessed the incident in different locations, Upper Engine and Medbay.\n[Alice]: I stand by my original testimony that Charlie eliminated Erin in Upper Engine, and Charlie's attempts to create confusion about location details only further prove their guilt as an impostor trying to avoid being voted out.\n[Bob]: I firmly maintain my position that Charlie is the impostor and we must vote them out immediately to protect our remaining crewmates from further elimination.\n[Dave]: I will continue to emphasize the consistent testimony from Alice, Bob, and myself, and highlight that Charlie's attempts to create doubt only further confirm their guilt as an impostor who eliminated Erin, making it crucial that we vote Charlie out to protect our remaining team members.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to point out that Alice, Bob, and Dave's testimonies are still inconsistent, as Alice claims the incident occurred in Upper Engine, while Bob and Dave claim it was in Medbay, and I urge the group to consider the possibility that they may be coordinating their efforts to frame me, rather than providing genuine eyewitness accounts.\n[Alice]: I will continue to firmly assert that Charlie eliminated Erin in Upper Engine, and the inconsistency Charlie points out is merely a desperate attempt to create doubt, as the core fact remains that all three of us witnessed Charlie's elimination of Erin, making it crucial that we vote Charlie out to protect our remaining crewmates.\n[Bob]: I will continue to firmly assert that Charlie eliminated Erin in Medbay, and the location discrepancy is irrelevant compared to the consistent testimony from Alice, Dave, and myself that Charlie is the impostor who must be voted out to protect our remaining crewmates.\n[Dave]: I will continue to emphasize the consistent testimony from Alice, Bob, and myself that Charlie eliminated Erin, and the minor location discrepancy does not change the core fact that Charlie must be voted out to protect our remaining crewmates from further elimination.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that the testimonies of Alice, Bob, and Dave are inconsistent regarding the location of the alleged incident, which raises doubts about the credibility of their claims, and I urge the group to carefully evaluate the evidence and consider the possibility that they may be working together to eliminate me.\n[Alice]: I stand by my original testimony that Charlie eliminated Erin in Upper Engine, and the consistent evidence from Bob, Dave, and myself clearly demonstrates Charlie's guilt as an impostor, regardless of minor location discrepancies.\n[Bob]: I will continue to firmly assert that Charlie is the impostor who

Alice and Bob's claims that Charlie eliminated Erin, so we must vote Charlie out to protect our remaining team members.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to address the accusations made by Alice,

wonder if they're trying to deflect attention from themselves.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I will vote to eject Charlie because Bob, Dave, and I have directly witnessed his elimination of Erin, and his attempt to cast doubt on our consistent testimony is a clear sign of an impostor trying to manipulate the discussion and avoid being voted out.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I am absolutely certain

inconsistent, as Alice claims the incident occurred in Upper Engine, while Bob and Dave claim it was in Medbay, and I urge the group to consider the possibility that they may be coordinating their efforts to frame me, rather than providing genuine eyewitness accounts.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I will continue to firmly assert that Charlie eliminated Erin in Upper Engine, and the inconsistency Charlie points out is merely a desperate attempt to create doubt, as the core fact remains that all three of us witnessed Charlie's elimination of Erin, making it crucial that we vote Charlie out to protect our remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I will continue to firmly assert that Charlie eliminated Erin in Medbay, and the location discrepancy is irrelevant compared to the
