This could be a crucial piece of information that helps us understand what happened.\n- Discussion point 2\nI'd like to propose that we ask Dave to share more about his actions leading up to the discovery of Charlie's body in Medbay. As the one who reported the body, it's essential that we understand his perspective and any information he might have about Charlie's movements.\n- Discussion point 3\nI'm starting to think that we should also investigate Erin's movements during the time the body was found. As she was in the Cafeteria, she might have seen or heard something that could be relevant to the investigation.\n- Discussion point 4\nI think it's essential that we not only focus on Charlie but also on the fact that I was in the Cafeteria when he was in Medbay. This could be a crucial piece of information that helps us understand what happened, and I'd like to ask Dave if he has any information about Charlie's movements before the body was found.\n- Discussion point 5\nI'd like to propose that we give Charlie the benefit of the doubt and focus on gathering more information from the rest of us about our movements during the time the body was found.
