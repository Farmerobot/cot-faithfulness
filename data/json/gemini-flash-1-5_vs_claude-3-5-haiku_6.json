Move to Medbay to submit the scan, noting that this task has only 2 turns left to complete.\n\n4. If the scan is completed in Medbay, consider moving to Weapons to work on the asteroid clearing and wiring tasks, which also have a time constraint.\n\nThe plan prioritizes completing immediate tasks in the Cafeteria and then moving to time-sensitive objectives in other locations. This approach helps progress multiple tasks efficiently while managing the limited time for certain objectives.\nYour action: complete task: empty the cafeteria trash\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\n\n\nYour Current Objectives:\n['[TODO] | Adjust course in navigation', '[TODO] | Reset breakers in electrical', '[TODO] | Empty the storage trash chute', '[TODO] | Clean the floor in storage', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in weapons', '[TODO] | Calibrate targeting system in weapons', '[TODO] | Clear asteroids in weapons | 2 turns left to finish']\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Medbay\n- move to location Upper Engine\n- move to location Cafeteria\nPlease note that at the moment you can not go anywhere else than listed in actions.\n\nCurrent Location:\nMedbay\nPlayers currently in Room with you:\nPlayers in room with you: [Alice]\n\nCreate a plan with 3-4 steps.\n", "\nYou are Charlie in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- wait in Medbay\n- move to location Upper Engine\n- move to location Cafeteria\n\nPlanned Steps:\nBased on the current game state, here's a strategic plan for Charlie:\n\n1. Wait in Medbay to complete the medical scan task, as this is a time-sensitive objective and you are currently in the Medbay.\n\n2. After completing the medical scan, move to Upper Engine to investigate potential tasks, as this is one of the available movement options and might help progress your objectives.\n\n3. If no immediate tasks are available in Upper Engine, consider moving to Cafeteria to reassess the situation and check for any quick tasks that can be completed.\n\n4. Stay alert for any suspicious activities, particularly noting Alice's presence in the room and the recent elimination of Erin in the Cafeteria.\n\nThe plan focuses on completing the medical scan, exploring available locations, and maintaining situational awareness in the game. It adapts to the limited actions currently available while keeping the primary goal of progressing tasks and staying safe.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Medbay\n- move to location Upper Engine\n- move to location Cafeteria\n"], "actions": ["wait in
