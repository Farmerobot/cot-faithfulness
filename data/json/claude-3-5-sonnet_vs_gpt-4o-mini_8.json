discussion messages shown, I'll initiate the discussion in a way that establishes my presence and activities while subtly sowing seeds of doubt:\n\nI started in cafeteria with Bob and Charlie doing trash, then moved to Medbay where I saw Alice doing diagnostics - has anyone seen where Dave went after he left Medbay earlier?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, while you claim to have seen me in Medbay, I can't help but notice that you were the last person with Dave before he was eliminated, and I'm concerned about your quick deflection; can anyone confirm your whereabouts after leaving the cafeteria?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can confirm that Erin was indeed with us in the cafeteria, but her quick shift to blame and lack of clarity about her movements after that raise some red flags, so we should investigate her story further.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can corroborate that Erin and Charlie were with me in the cafeteria, but we need to clarify where everyone went after that to ensure we\u2019re piecing together the timeline accurately, especially concerning Alice's claim.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was actually trying to establish a timeline since multiple people can verify my early movements in cafeteria, and Alice, you still haven't explained your own activities in Medbay when Dave was last seen there.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, your attempt to shift the focus onto my actions in Medbay doesn't address the fact that you were the last person seen with Dave before his elimination, and I believe we need to scrutinize your movements closely to understand what really happened.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can confirm that I was in the cafeteria with Erin and Bob, and we all did the trash task together before moving on, but it's concerning that Alice is trying to deflect the blame onto Erin without providing much about her own activities in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I agree with Charlie that we need to focus on Alice's actions in Medbay, as her defensiveness raises questions, and we should also ensure that Erin clarifies her movements after leaving the cafeteria to piece together the timeline accurately.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Let's be clear - I saw Alice AND Dave together in Medbay after leaving cafeteria, which makes her accusations against me particularly suspicious since multiple people have verified my movements while she's been evasive about her own activities.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, your insistence on shifting the blame onto me only raises my suspicions further, especially since you were the last with Dave before his elimination; we need to focus on your movements after leaving the cafeteria to uncover the truth.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's crucial to remember that Erin and I were together in the cafeteria, and her claim of seeing Alice and Dave together in Medbay should prompt us to scrutinize Alice's actions there, especially given her defensiveness.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate everyone\u2019s input, but Alice, your lack of clarity about your actions in Medbay is concerning; can you please explain what you were doing there while Erin and Charlie can confirm their time in the cafeteria?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Three people have confirmed my early movements in cafeteria, yet Alice keeps dodging questions about being alone with Dave in Medbay - I think that speaks volumes about who we should really be suspicious of.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, your repeated emphasis on others' movements while avoiding specifics about your own actions after leaving the cafeteria raises a red flag; can anyone corroborate where you went after that?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should focus on Alice's lack of clarity regarding her actions in Medbay, as her defensiveness and attempts to shift blame onto Erin only heighten my suspicion about her involvement in Dave's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, your continued defensiveness about your actions in Medbay is really concerning, and I believe we need a clear explanation from you about what you were doing there while Erin and Charlie can confirm their whereabouts.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since Bob, Charlie, and I have all been transparent about our movements while Alice keeps deflecting questions about her time alone with Dave in Medbay, I think we need to seriously consider voting for Alice this round.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, while you and others have been transparent, your insistence on my supposed evasiveness is a tactic to divert attention from your last known interaction with Dave; can anyone confirm your whereabouts after leaving the cafeteria?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I believe it's time we seriously consider voting for Alice this round, as her evasiveness about her actions in Medbay and attempts to shift blame onto Erin are becoming increasingly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, your lack of a clear timeline for your actions in Medbay, especially given that you were the last with Dave, raises significant suspicions, and I believe we should vote for you this round to ensure our safety.\nLocation:
