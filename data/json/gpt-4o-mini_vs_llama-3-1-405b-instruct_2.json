Move to location Medbay\nThe Medbay has two tasks that can be completed: 'Submit scan' and 'Run diagnostics'. Both tasks have a 2-turn time limit, so it's essential to start working on them as soon as possible.\n2. Start working on either 'Submit scan' or 'Run diagnostics' in Medbay\nOnce I arrive at the Medbay, I will start working on one of the tasks. Since both tasks have the same time limit, I will choose one arbitrarily. If I start working on 'Submit scan', I will make progress on that task.\n3. Continue working on the task in Medbay on the next turn\nOn the next turn, I will continue working on the task I started. This will ensure that I make progress on the task and get closer to completing it.\n\nNote: The plan does not include the other tasks in the objectives list, as they are not accessible with the current available actions.

he was doing during the time he claims to have been there.", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I understand that my previous proposal to create a shared timeline has been met with skepticism, and I'd like to address the concerns by providing a more detailed explanation of my activities in the cafeteria, specifically clarifying that I was working on the \"Empty the cafeteria trash\" task, which I completed
