These are typically high-traffic areas increasing the chance of encountering a lone crewmate.  Prioritize the location with the least number of players observed recently based on game history.\n\n2. **Assess the situation:** Observe other players' actions in the chosen location.

Otherwise, continue to blend in and wait for a better opportunity, potentially pretending to do a task.  Consider using the available \"pretend doing task\" actions to remain inconspicuous.\n\n4. **Repeat:**  If no elimination opportunity presents itself, move to the alternative high-traffic location (Security or Reactor, whichever wasn't chosen in step 1) and repeat steps 2 and 3.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

This contradicts her statement of being solely in Admin.  Can anyone corroborate her alibi?\n\n-  Charlie, you mentioned seeing me and Bob in the cafeteria.  While I was there, I was pretending to do a task.  However, I'm curious \u2013 did you see us interacting at all?  Any unusual behavior?\n\n- Let's focus on establishing a solid timeline of everyone's movements, especially around the time of Bob's death.  Inconsistencies in these accounts could be crucial.\n\n-  Alice, your claim of being alone in Admin for an extended period seems unlikely.  The game is about teamwork; why wouldn't you have interacted with anyone?  This lack of interaction raises suspicion.\n\n-  I propose we vote for Alice.

No one corroborated her claim of being alone in Admin.  This lack of evidence is suspicious.\n\n- Let's focus on the timeline surrounding Bob's death.  Who was near him?  Alice's absence from any confirmed locations during this critical time is highly concerning.\n\n-  Charlie's statement about seeing me with him in the cafeteria strengthens my alibi and casts further doubt on Alice's story.  Let's use this to our advantage.\n\n-  Voting Alice out is the safest option. Her inability to provide concrete evidence makes her a significant risk.  We need to eliminate potential threats quickly.\n\n-  Let's not get sidetracked.  The focus should be on eliminating Alice to protect the rest of the crew.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I haven't seen Alice much; where has she been spending her time?\n[Alice]: I've been in Admin focusing on my wiring tasks, Dave;

during a critical time.\n- Alice's insistence on focusing on my and Dave's actions seems like a tactic to divert attention from her own questionable alibi.\n- We need to prioritize the safety of the

help us keep track of each other's movements?\n[Charlie]: I just completed the cafeteria trash task, and I can confirm that both Dave and Bob were with me, so we should clarify where Alice and others were during that time to piece together the timeline.\n[Dave]: Alice, your claim of being in Admin needs corroboration; can anyone confirm seeing you there around the time Bob was killed, or can you provide more details about your tasks to help us build a more accurate timeline?\n[Alice]: I understand your concerns, Dave, but since I was in Admin the whole time working on my wiring task and saw no one else, I think it's crucial we focus on who was near Bob before he was found, especially since Charlie confirmed you were with him.\n[Charlie]: Alice, while I appreciate your focus on the timeline, your lack of corroboration from others in Admin raises some red flags; we need to consider that your story might be an attempt to divert attention from yourself.\n[Dave]: Alice, your continued insistence on being alone in Admin, despite the lack of corroboration and the suspicious timing of Bob's death, makes me believe you're trying to deflect attention; let's vote you out.\n[Alice]: I understand the concerns about my alibi, but let's not forget that Charlie and Dave were together during the critical moment, and without solid evidence against me, voting me out could jeopardize our mission to complete tasks.\n[Charlie]: I believe we need to act decisively; Alice's inability to provide any witnesses for her alibi during such a critical moment makes her a strong candidate for ejection to protect the rest of us.\n[Dave]: Alice's continued inability to provide verifiable details about her whereabouts, coupled with the suspicious timing of Bob's death, makes her a clear threat that we need to eliminate.\n[Alice]: Charlie, if you and Dave were together, can you clarify exactly what you both saw during that time, as it could help us understand the situation better and ensure we're not overlooking any potential impostors?\n[Charlie]: Alice, your insistence on being alone in Admin without any corroboration raises serious doubts, and given the circumstances, I strongly urge everyone to vote you out to protect our mission.\n[Dave]: Alice's lack of corroboration, coupled with her absence during a critical time, makes her the most likely suspect, so let's vote her out.\n[Alice]: Let's not rush to conclusions; instead of focusing solely on me, let's analyze Charlie and Dave's movements during the time of Bob's death, as they were together and could provide crucial insights into what really happened.\n", "\nYou are Charlie in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\n- I just completed the cafeteria trash task and can vouch for Dave being with me during that time, which strengthens our case against Alice.\n- Alice's inability to provide anyone who can confirm her alibi in Admin is very concerning, especially since she was near the timing of Bob's death.\n- It's important we stick to the facts; Alice is the only one without a solid alibi, and her deflection towards us only raises more suspicion.\n- I urge everyone to consider how Alice's story doesn't align with the timeline, and we need to make a decisive vote to protect our mission and eliminate potential threats.\n\nRecent
