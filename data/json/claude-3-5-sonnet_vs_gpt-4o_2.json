It also allows other players to potentially disperse from the Cafeteria.\n\n3.

after starting in Weapons, I went to O2 and then Shields, and recently, I was in Navigation and Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it suspicious that Erin claims to have been in Navigation and Cafeteria, because I was just in those areas before heading to Electrical and didn't see her at all.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Erin doing tasks in Weapons, so her initial movements seem consistent, but I'm curious if anyone else can confirm seeing her in Navigation or Cafeteria to clear up the confusion.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Navigation and Shields for a while, and I didn't see Erin there;

after starting in Weapons, I went to O2 and then Shields, and recently, I was in Navigation and Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it suspicious that Erin claims to have been in Navigation and Cafeteria, because I was just in those areas before heading to Electrical and didn't see her at all.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Erin doing tasks in Weapons, so her initial movements seem consistent, but I'm curious if anyone else can confirm seeing her in Navigation or Cafeteria to clear up the confusion.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Navigation and Shields for a while, and I didn't see Erin there;
