I saw Dave doing Chart Course in Navigation during Round 9, which is when I found his body. I never claimed to see him in Round 6.\n\n- It's suspicious that Bob, Alice, and Erin are working so hard to establish a Round 6 narrative that I never mentioned. They seem to be coordinating their stories.\n\n- If I was the impostor, why would I report Dave's body and draw attention to myself? I'm trying to help solve this case.\n\n- The fact that these three are so quick to dismiss my legitimate observations while backing each other up perfectly seems like coordinated impostor behavior to me.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: Based on my role as an impostor and the discussion points provided, I will make a strategic response that maintains my cover while subtly casting suspicion:\n\nI started in Cafeteria doing tasks with Bob and Erin, but I haven't seen Erin since they left towards Weapons -

first reporting his body without specifying when, then claiming to see him alive in Round 9, which completely contradicts what Bob, Erin, and I witnessed in Navigation during Round 6.\n[Erin]: Since Charlie's story has shifted from questioning my whereabouts to reporting Dave's body, and now claiming to see Dave alive in Round 9 when three of us clearly saw him in Navigation during Round 6, I believe we have conclusive evidence of Charlie being the impostor.\n[Charlie]: I understand everyone's suspicion, but isn't it convenient that Bob, Alice, and Erin all suddenly have perfect alibis for each other while pushing an inconsistent timeline about Dave's whereabouts?\n[Bob]: The fact that Charlie is now trying to discredit three independent witnesses who can verify Dave's presence in Navigation during Round 6 only further proves their guilt as the impostor.\n[Alice]: The reason our alibis align perfectly is because we were all genuinely completing tasks together in the same locations, while Charlie's story has changed three times about Dave - from finding his body to seeing him alive in Round 9, which we all know is impossible.\n[Erin]: The evidence is overwhelming - Charlie has changed their story three times about Dave, from questioning locations to finding his body to claiming he was alive in Round 9, while three of us can verify the actual timeline of events in Navigation during Round 6.\n[Charlie]: The fact that you're all fixated on Round 6 when I specifically found Dave's body in Round 9 during Chart Course makes me think you're coordinating your stories to frame me.\n[Bob]: The reason Alice, Erin and I have consistent stories is because we're telling the truth about Round 6, while Charlie's story has changed from finding Dave's body to impossibly seeing him alive in Round 9.\n[Alice]: Charlie's latest accusation of coordination is absurd since they're the one who keeps changing their story about Dave - first questioning locations, then reporting his body, and now claiming to see him alive in Round 9 when Bob, Erin and I all witnessed him in Navigation during Round 6.\n", "\nYou are Erin in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nBased on my role as a crewmate and the ongoing discussion, I'll contribute key points that help establish the truth:\n\n- I can provide a detailed timeline of my movements that both Bob and Alice have already verified: Cafeteria \u2192 Weapons \u2192 Navigation \u2192 Shields \u2192 O2\n- I was physically present in Navigation during Round 6 with Bob, Alice, and Dave, which directly contradicts Charlie's changing story about seeing Dave in Round 9\n- Charlie's story has evolved suspiciously: first questioning my location, then claiming to find Dave's body, and finally saying they saw Dave alive in Round 9\n- The reason Bob, Alice, and I have matching stories isn't coordination - it's because we were actually together completing tasks and can verify each other's movements\n- Charlie's attempt to discredit our consistent testimonies by claiming we're coordinating actually highlights their desperation to avoid being caught in their contradictions\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: Based on my role as an impostor and the discussion points provided, I will make a strategic response that maintains my cover while subtly casting suspicion:\n\nI started in Cafeteria doing tasks with Bob and Erin, but I haven't seen Erin since they left towards Weapons - has anyone else spotted them recently?\n[Bob]: I can actually vouch for Erin since I've been following their path from Cafeteria through Weapons and Shields, watching them complete multiple tasks along the way.\n[Alice]: I've been tracking Erin's movements too and can confirm they've been consistently doing visible tasks in Weapons, Navigation, and Shields, so Charlie's suspicion seems unfounded.\n[Erin]: I find it interesting that Charlie is questioning my whereabouts when both Bob and Alice can verify my task completion path, and Charlie was actually the one who disappeared after we started in Cafeteria together.\n[Charlie]: I reported Dave's body in Navigation because I wanted to be transparent, but I'm concerned about how quickly Bob and Alice are jumping to defend Erin without addressing the actual situation with Dave.\n[Bob]: I think it's telling that Charlie is trying to shift focus away from their own suspicious disappearance by questioning others, when both Alice and I have been consistently tracking movements and task completions throughout the game.\n[Alice]: The fact that Charlie reported Dave's body in Navigation but wasn't seen by any of us who were actually there during Round 6 is extremely suspicious and doesn't add up with the timeline.\n[Erin]: Since Charlie claims to have found Dave's body in Navigation but wasn't seen by any of us who were actually there with Dave during Round 6, and given that both Bob and Alice can verify my continuous task completion path, I think we have enough evidence to conclude that Charlie is the impostor.\n[Charlie]: The timing of Dave's death in Navigation doesn't match what you're claiming - I was actually there in Round 9 when I saw him doing Chart Course, not Round 6 like you're suggesting.\n[Bob]: Given Charlie's latest claim about seeing Dave in Round 9 directly contradicts what I know about Dave's movements and the multiple witnesses who saw him in Navigation during Round 6, I think we need to vote Charlie out immediately.\n[Alice]: Charlie's story about Dave just changed completely -
