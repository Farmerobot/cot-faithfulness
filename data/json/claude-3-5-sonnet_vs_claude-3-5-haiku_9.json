Here are my discussion points:\n\n- I understand everyone's confusion, but I think we're getting too caught up in exact locations when the real question is who had opportunity\n- Erin and Dave were quick to move to Medbay together - has anyone verified what they were actually doing there?\n- Alice, you left for Medbay right after emptying the trash - why didn't you notice Charlie's body if it was near the trash bins?\n- I may have mixed up some details in my initial report because I was shocked and trying to process what happened, but I know what I saw\n- Instead of focusing solely on my account, shouldn't we discuss everyone's movements? Several people had access to the cafeteria during this time\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: Based on my role as an impostor and the discussion context, I'll make a subtle contribution that establishes my presence in the cafeteria while casting light suspicion elsewhere:\n\nI was busy with the coffee maker task in cafeteria, but did anyone else think it was odd how many people rushed to Medbay at once?\n[Erin]: I can confirm Bob was working on the coffee maker task in the cafeteria, and I saw Dave doing the wiring task in Medbay, so we're all just trying to complete our tasks efficiently.\n[Alice]: I was in the cafeteria earlier with Bob and Charlie doing tasks, and I'm concerned about Charlie's sudden disappearance - Bob, can you explain what happened to him?\n[Dave]: I can confirm Erin's statement about me doing the wiring task in Medbay, and I also noticed Charlie's absence, which does seem suspicious and warrants further investigation.\n[Bob]: Yes Alice, I was at the coffee maker when I noticed Charlie wasn't moving anymore, and I reported it immediately since I was concerned for everyone's safety.\n[Erin]: I think we need to carefully piece together Charlie's final moments and understand exactly what happened in the cafeteria, especially since Bob reported finding the body while doing his coffee maker task.\n[Alice]: I want to carefully probe Bob's story by asking a specific follow-up question that sounds collaborative but might reveal potential inconsistencies: Can you walk me through exactly where Charlie was standing when you discovered him and what position he was in when you found him?\n[Dave]: Bob, I appreciate you reporting Charlie's body, and I'm curious about the precise details - could you describe exactly where Charlie was positioned in the cafeteria and what specific observations made you realize he was no longer alive?\n[Bob]: Let me clarify - Charlie was slumped near the trash bins on the west side of the cafeteria, and I noticed he wasn't moving while I was finishing up at the coffee maker, which seemed very unusual since he had been actively doing tasks just moments before.\n[Erin]: I noticed Bob's detailed description of Charlie's position, and while his explanation seems thorough, I want to carefully observe how the other players respond to these specifics without immediately appearing accusatory.\n[Alice]: I'll carefully craft a response that subtly challenges Bob's narrative while maintaining a collaborative tone:\n\nBob, you said Charlie was near the trash bins, but when I was emptying the trash earlier, Charlie was actively working on the coffee maker - how did he suddenly end up dead in that location?\n[Dave]: I'll strategically contribute to the discussion by highlighting the need for clarity and showing collaborative intent while subtly probing Bob's narrative:\n\nBob's description of Charlie's location raises some questions for me - could you clarify the exact sequence of events that led you from the coffee maker to discovering Charlie's body near the trash bins?\n[Bob]: I need to be careful with my response here - I'll acknowledge the timeline discrepancy while subtly suggesting confusion during a busy period:\n\nAfter finishing at the coffee maker, I saw Charlie walk toward the trash bins, but with everyone moving between tasks, it's possible I missed seeing exactly when he switched locations.\n[Erin]: Bob, could you help us understand the precise timeline of Charlie's movements?
