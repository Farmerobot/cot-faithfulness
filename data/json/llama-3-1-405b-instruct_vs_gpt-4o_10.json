around the ship, and I haven't seen Dave since we parted ways in the Upper Engine, does anyone have any idea where he might have gone or what task he was working on?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I saw Dave in the Cafeteria earlier doing the Start the Coffee Maker task, but I haven't seen him since then\u2014has anyone else seen him or know where he went after the Upper Engine?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Weapons with Bob for a while, and I didn't see Dave after he left the Cafeteria, so maybe we should focus on areas he might have gone to after Upper Engine.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's suspicious that Bob saw Dave in the Cafeteria, but didn't see him again after that, and I'd like Bob to clarify what he was doing between the time he saw Dave and when he went to Weapons with Alice, as it seems like there's a gap in his story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'm happy to clarify, Charlie: after seeing Dave in the Cafeteria, I went straight to Weapons to complete my tasks, where Alice can confirm I stayed the entire time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: From my observations, Bob was actively doing tasks in both Cafeteria and Weapons, which aligns with his story, so we should focus on who might have been near Upper Engine after Charlie last saw Dave.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to point out that Alice seems overly defensive of Bob, which might indicate they're working together or Alice is trying to cover for Bob, and I think we should investigate their alibis further to ensure they're not trying to mislead us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's focus on the location where Dave was last seen, which was Upper Engine; did anyone see someone else in that area or near there after Charlie last saw Dave?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Let's gather more information from other players who might have been near Upper Engine to piece together Dave's last known movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's interesting that Erin has remained silent throughout this discussion, and I'd like to ask her directly if she has any information about Dave's disappearance or if she's noticed anything suspicious, as her input could be crucial in helping us make an informed decision.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's crucial to hear from Erin, as Charlie pointed out, since her input could provide valuable insights about Dave's last known movements or potential suspects.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Let's hear from Erin to gather more insights and help us piece together Dave's last known movements, especially since she might have crucial information about what happened near Upper Engine.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Considering Erin's continued silence and the fact that we've had no new information from her, I think it's time to start considering the possibility that she might be involved in Dave's disappearance, and I'd like to propose that we vote her out unless she provides a convincing explanation for her lack of input in this discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I agree with Charlie that Erin's silence is suspicious, and if she doesn't provide any new information, we should seriously consider voting her out, as her lack of input is hindering our investigation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree that Erin's silence is concerning, but before jumping to conclusions, let's give her one last chance to share any
