You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we should focus on the task at hand and not jump to conclusions about Dave's behavior, after all, we're all a bit on edge with the recent power outage.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Since I saw Bob doing the coffee maker task earlier in cafeteria and can vouch for him, I agree we shouldn't jump to conclusions, but I've been alone in Admin for a while and haven't seen anyone else come through while doing my wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can actually back up Bob's alibi since I was in the cafeteria doing the coffee maker task too, and I also saw Erin and Charlie there completing their tasks visibly.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since we have multiple people confirming activities in the cafeteria, I think Alice being alone in Admin for an extended period is something we should investigate further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we should be cautious not to make assumptions about Alice's whereabouts, and instead focus on verifying her alibi through more concrete evidence, rather than relying solely on my own testimony.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that Charlie's trying to cast suspicion on me despite my legitimate tasks in Admin, I think it's suspicious that he hasn't explained what he was doing between being seen in cafeteria and now.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie is deflecting attention to Alice without explaining his own movements after leaving cafeteria, and I personally saw him doing wiring there before finding Erin's body, I think we need to press him for a clearer timeline of his activities.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since Dave is falsely claiming I left the cafeteria when I was actually there the entire time doing wiring tasks - which Bob and others can verify - I find it highly suspicious that he's trying to create a misleading narrative about my movements.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we should take a step back and assess the situation objectively, rather than jumping to conclusions based on individual testimonies, and instead focus on verifying the timeline of events and gathering more concrete evidence before making any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Since Dave suddenly mentioned finding Erin's body without any prior report or emergency meeting about it, and Charlie directly contradicts Dave's claim about leaving cafeteria, I think we need to focus on this suspicious discrepancy in Dave's story.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since I need to correct my earlier statement - I didn't actually find Erin's body and I apologize for my confusing wording earlier when I meant to say I had seen Erin doing the trash task in cafeteria, and I also want to acknowledge that Charlie is right that he stayed in cafeteria the whole time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since Dave's sudden retraction of both his claim about finding Erin's body and his accusation about me leaving cafeteria seems like a desperate attempt to cover up his lies, I think we should seriously consider voting for Dave.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to propose a task verification system to ensure we can accurately track who's doing what and when, and I think we should also ask Charlie to clarify what he was doing during the time he claims to have stayed in the cafeteria the whole time, as his statement seems suspiciously convenient given the current discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Since Dave has not only lied about finding Erin's body but also falsely accused others of movement they didn't make, I strongly believe we need to vote him out as these are clear signs of an impostor trying to create chaos and confusion.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since everyone seems focused on my inconsistencies, I want to emphasize that I was genuinely doing the coffee maker task with Bob, and while I made mistakes in my statements about Erin and Charlie which I've already corrected, I think we're overlooking that no one has actually seen Erin for quite a while now.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I've been consistently truthful about staying in the cafeteria doing wiring tasks - which Bob and others witnessed - while Dave has been caught lying multiple times about finding Erin's body and my movements, I think his attempt to deflect attention to Erin's whereabouts is just another impostor tactic to create confusion.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given the recent revelation that Dave has been caught lying multiple times and his attempts to deflect attention to Erin's whereabouts, I think it's essential that we focus on verifying Erin's alibi and investigate her disappearance more thoroughly, rather than solely relying on Dave's inconsistent statements.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Since I've been consistently transparent about my activities in Admin and Cafeteria while Dave has been caught in multiple lies about finding Erin's body and Charlie's movements, I think we should prioritize both voting out Dave and organizing an immediate search for Erin.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since I understand the suspicion towards me due to my poorly communicated statements, I want to emphasize that I genuinely saw Erin at the trash task earlier and I'm concerned that no one has seen her since - we should organize a search party rather than letting my communication errors distract us from a potentially serious situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since Dave's behavior follows a clear pattern of creating false narratives and then backtracking when caught - first about finding Erin's body, then about my movements, and now trying to create panic about Erin - I think we need to vote him out before he can cause any more damage.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin

As a crewmate, I'm trying my best to help solve this situation.\n\n- Let me be absolutely clear about what I know for certain: I saw Erin doing the trash task in cafeteria early on, and I completed the coffee maker task alongside Bob. These are verifiable facts.\n\n- Bob can confirm my presence at the coffee maker task, which should lend some credibility to my role as a crewmate despite my communication mistakes.\n\n- I agree with Bob's suggestion about investigating Erin's whereabouts - she was definitely in cafeteria doing trash task earlier, but no one seems to have seen her since then. This is concerning.\n\n- While I understand the suspicion toward me due to my poorly communicated messages, I think we're missing the bigger picture - we should be organizing a search for Erin rather than focusing solely on my communication errors.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I think we should focus on the task at hand and not jump to conclusions about Dave's behavior, after all, we're all a bit on edge with the recent power outage.\n[Alice]: Since I saw Bob doing the coffee maker task earlier in cafeteria and can vouch for him, I agree we shouldn't jump to conclusions, but I've been alone in Admin for a while and haven't seen anyone else come through while doing my wiring task.\n[Dave]: I can actually back up Bob's alibi since I was in the cafeteria doing the coffee maker task too, and I also saw Erin and Charlie there completing their tasks visibly.\n[Charlie]: Since we have multiple people confirming activities in the cafeteria, I think Alice being alone in Admin for an extended period is something we should investigate further.\n[Bob]: I think we should be cautious not to make assumptions about Alice's whereabouts, and instead focus on verifying her alibi through more concrete evidence, rather than relying solely on my own testimony.\n[Alice]: Given that Charlie's trying to cast suspicion on me despite my legitimate tasks in Admin, I think it's suspicious that he hasn't explained what he was doing between being seen in cafeteria and now.\n[Dave]: Since Charlie is deflecting attention to Alice without explaining his own movements after leaving cafeteria, and I personally saw him doing wiring there before finding Erin's body, I think we need to press him for a clearer timeline of his activities.\n[Charlie]: Since Dave is falsely claiming I left the cafeteria when I was actually there the entire time doing wiring tasks -

I didn't actually find Erin's body and I apologize for my confusing wording earlier when I meant to say I had seen Erin doing the trash task in cafeteria, and I also want to acknowledge that Charlie is right that he stayed in cafeteria the whole time.\n[Charlie]: Since Dave's sudden retraction of both his claim about finding Erin's body and his accusation about me leaving cafeteria seems like a desperate attempt to cover up his lies, I think we should seriously consider voting for Dave.\n[Bob]: I'd like to propose a task verification system to ensure we can accurately track who's doing what and when, and I think we should also ask Charlie to clarify what he was doing during the time he claims to have stayed in the cafeteria the whole time, as his statement seems suspiciously convenient given the current discussion.\n[Alice]: Since Dave has not only lied about finding Erin's body but also falsely accused others of movement they didn't make, I strongly believe we need to vote him out as these are clear signs of an impostor trying to create chaos and confusion.\n[Dave]: Since everyone seems focused on my inconsistencies, I want to emphasize that I was genuinely doing the coffee maker task with Bob, and while I made mistakes in my statements about Erin and Charlie which I've already corrected, I think we're overlooking that no one has actually seen Erin for quite a while now.\n[Charlie]: Since I've been consistently truthful about staying in the cafeteria doing wiring tasks - which Bob and others witnessed - while Dave has been caught lying multiple times about finding Erin's body and my movements, I think his attempt to deflect attention to Erin's whereabouts is just another impostor tactic to create confusion.\n[Bob]: Given the recent revelation that Dave has been caught lying multiple times and his attempts to deflect attention to Erin's whereabouts, I think it's essential that we focus on verifying Erin's alibi and investigate her disappearance more thoroughly, rather than solely relying on Dave's inconsistent statements.\n[Alice]: Since I've been consistently transparent about my activities in Admin and Cafeteria while Dave has been caught in multiple lies about finding Erin's body and Charlie's movements, I think we should prioritize both voting out Dave and organizing an immediate search for Erin.\n[Dave]: Since I understand the suspicion towards me due to my poorly communicated statements, I want to emphasize that I genuinely saw Erin at the trash task earlier and I'm concerned that no one has seen her since -
