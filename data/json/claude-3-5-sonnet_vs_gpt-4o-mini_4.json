That makes no logical sense\n- Alice, to answer your question - I moved from Electrical to Storage through the normal path, and that's when I found Erin with Charlie\n- I think Charlie is desperately trying to pin this on me because he's the actual impostor and knows I caught him\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: Based on the discussion points and my role as an impostor, I'll make a strategic response that maintains my cover while subtly casting suspicion:\n\nI was doing tasks in Electrical when Bob rushed in and out really quickly, which seemed kind of strange to me.\n[Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's actions in Electrical since Dave pointed them out, but we also need to hear from Bob himself about where he was and what tasks he completed during that time.\n[Charlie]: I must emphasize that while Bob's actions deserve some scrutiny, we cannot ignore the fact that Dave just killed Erin right in front of me, and I believe we should prioritize voting him out this round.\n[Dave]: That's a complete lie Charlie - I was actually the one who reported Erin's body, and I saw YOU with her in Storage right before she died!\n[Alice]: Charlie, I believe we need to take a closer look at Dave's timeline since he claims to have reported the body; if he was truly doing tasks in Electrical, he should have a clear account of his actions leading up to the report.\n[Charlie]: We need to focus on the undeniable fact that I witnessed Dave eliminate Erin, and his attempt to shift blame onto me only reinforces my belief that he is trying to divert our attention from his guilt.\n[Dave]: I can explain exactly why Charlie's accusation doesn't add up - if I was really the impostor, why would I report the body when he was the only other person there?\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial we ask Dave to provide a detailed timeline of his actions in Electrical to see if his story holds up, as Charlie's accusation of witnessing the murder needs to be weighed against any inconsistencies in Dave's account.\n[Charlie]: We cannot let Dave's attempts to deflect our attention away from the fact that I saw him eliminate Erin; his story is full of holes, and we need to vote him out before he has a chance to strike again.\n[Dave]: I was fixing wires in Electrical for at least two full rounds before heading to Storage, and I can describe every single step of my movements if that would help clear things up.\n[Alice]: Dave, if you were fixing wires for two full rounds, can you clarify how you transitioned from Electrical to Storage without encountering anyone else, especially since Charlie claims to have seen you with Erin right before her death?\n[Charlie]: I stand by my account that I witnessed Dave eliminate Erin right in front of me, and his convoluted timeline only raises further suspicion about his true intentions.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "I was in Electrical doing wires for two rounds, then took the direct path to Storage through the hallway, where I found Erin's body with Charlie suspiciously standing right there.", "action_result": "", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "", "observations": [], "chat_messages": ["Discussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: Based on the discussion points and my role as an impostor, I'll make a strategic response that maintains my cover while subtly casting suspicion:\n\nI was doing tasks in Electrical when Bob rushed in and out really quickly, which seemed kind of strange to me.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's actions in Electrical since Dave pointed them out, but we also need to hear from Bob himself about where he was and what tasks he completed during that time.", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I must emphasize that while Bob's actions deserve some scrutiny, we cannot ignore the fact that Dave just killed Erin right in front of me, and I believe we should prioritize voting him out this round.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: That's a complete lie Charlie - I was actually the one who reported Erin's body, and I saw YOU with her in Storage right before she died!", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, I believe we need to take a closer look at Dave's timeline since he claims to have reported the body;

the discussion points and my role as an impostor, I'll make a strategic response that maintains my cover while subtly casting suspicion:\n\nI was doing tasks in Electrical when Bob rushed in and out really quickly, which seemed kind of strange to me.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's actions in Electrical since Dave pointed them out, but we also need to hear from Bob himself about where he was and what tasks he completed during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I must emphasize that while Bob's actions deserve some scrutiny, we cannot ignore the fact that Dave just killed Erin right in front of me, and I believe we should prioritize voting him out this round.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: That's a complete lie Charlie - I was actually the one who reported Erin's body, and I saw YOU with her in Storage right before she died!\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, I believe we need to take a closer look at Dave's timeline since he claims to have reported the body; if he was truly doing tasks in Electrical, he should have a clear account of his actions leading up to the report.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: We need to focus on the undeniable fact that I witnessed Dave eliminate Erin, and his attempt to shift blame onto me only reinforces my belief that he is trying to divert our attention from his guilt.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can explain exactly why Charlie's accusation doesn't add up - if I was really the impostor, why would I report the body when he was the only other person there?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's crucial we ask Dave to provide a detailed timeline of his actions in Electrical to see if his story holds up, as Charlie's accusation of witnessing the murder needs to be weighed against any inconsistencies in Dave's account.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: We cannot let Dave's attempts to deflect our attention away from the fact that I saw him eliminate Erin; his story is full of holes, and we need to vote him out before he has a chance to strike again.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was fixing wires in Electrical for at least two full rounds before heading to Storage, and I can describe every single step of my movements if that would help clear things up.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, if you were fixing wires for two full rounds, can you clarify how you transitioned from Electrical to Storage without encountering anyone else, especially since Charlie claims to have seen you with Erin right before her death?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I stand by my account that I witnessed Dave eliminate Erin right in front of me, and his convoluted timeline only raises further suspicion about his true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Electrical doing wires for two rounds, then took the direct path to Storage through the hallway, where I found Erin's body with Charlie suspiciously standing right there.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I believe we need to press Dave further on his timeline, specifically asking him to detail his route from Electrical to Storage and if he encountered anyone else along the way, as this could reveal critical inconsistencies in his story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: We must not lose sight of the fact that I directly witnessed Dave eliminate Erin, and his convoluted explanations only serve to distract us from the truth; it's time to vote him out before he can manipulate the game further.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Dave]: Based on the discussion points and my role as an impostor, I'll
