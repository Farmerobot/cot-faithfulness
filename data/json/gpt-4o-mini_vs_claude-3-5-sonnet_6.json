I've been working alongside her in Admin and Storage, and I can also confirm seeing Charlie doing tasks in Cafeteria earlier, so I think we should focus our attention on Bob's movements after he left Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up since he was actually in Cafeteria with me, Erin, and Dave during round 1 when I completed the coffee maker task, and I can prove my innocence since Erin saw me do visual tasks in Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, it\u2019s interesting that you\u2019re trying to shift the focus onto me when you were the last one seen with Erin before her unfortunate demise; why didn\u2019t you mention your tasks in Medbay earlier, and shouldn\u2019t we scrutinize your movements more closely?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given all these inconsistencies in Bob's story and the fact that he was last seen with Erin before her death, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Bob as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's crucial to point out that I personally witnessed Bob and Charlie both in Cafeteria during Round 1, but Bob's claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is very suspicious since she's no longer here to confirm it.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's lies about being alone in Cafeteria when Dave and others clearly saw him there with us, plus his suspicious appearance in Medbay right before Erin's death, make him the most likely impostor rather than me, who has been transparent about all my movements.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's attempts to deflect blame onto me are getting desperate, especially since he was the last one seen with Erin before her demise; we should definitely vote him out to clear the air and focus on our tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's confirmation about both Bob and Charlie being in Cafeteria during Round 1, and Bob's unverifiable claim about Erin and Medbay, I think we have enough evidence to conclude that Bob is being deceptive and should be voted out.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can definitively state that Bob is being deceptive - while I did see him in Cafeteria with Charlie and Erin during Round 1, his convenient story about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks when she's no longer here to confirm seems like a desperate attempt to create an alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has already confirmed seeing me, Charlie, and Erin together in Cafeteria during Round 1, why is Charlie still lying about being alone there, and why did he conveniently show up in Medbay right before Erin's death?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's frantic attempts to redirect blame onto me only highlight his own inconsistencies; with Alice and Dave backing my alibi, it's clear we should vote him out and eliminate the impostor threat.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I understand everyone's confusion about Round 1, but the key issue here is Bob's unverifiable claim about Erin in Medbay and the fact that he was the last person seen with her before her death, so I strongly believe we need to vote for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to emphasize one final time that while I can confirm Bob was in Cafeteria with us during Round 1, his story about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is highly suspicious since she's no longer here to confirm it, and combined with him being the last person seen with her, this makes him our most likely impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave keeps confirming I was in Cafeteria with everyone during Round 1, why are you all ignoring the fact that Charlie is blatantly lying about being alone there, and more importantly, why did he suddenly appear in Medbay right before Erin's death?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's continuous attempts to shift blame towards me only highlight his desperation, especially since he was the last person seen with Erin, and with Alice and Dave confirming my alibi, it's clear we need to vote him out to eliminate the impostor threat.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: While I acknowledge my earlier mistake about Charlie being alone in Cafeteria during Round 1, the most damning evidence against Bob remains his unverifiable claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks and the fact that he was the last person seen with her before her death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Bob's presence in Cafeteria during Round 1 with Charlie and Erin, his later claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is not only impossible but also seems like a calculated attempt to use her death to create a false alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be crystal clear - I never claimed Erin \"verified\" my tasks, I only stated she was present in Medbay when I was doing them, and Charlie's appearance there right after, combined with his lies about being alone in Cafeteria (which Dave confirmed was false), makes him extremely suspicious.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 10\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1. **Pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria** -

I never claimed Erin \"verified\" my tasks, I only stated she was present in Medbay when I was doing them, and Charlie's appearance there right after, combined with his lies about being alone in Cafeteria (which Dave confirmed was false), makes him extremely suspicious.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 10\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1. **Pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria** -

I never claimed Erin \"verified\" my tasks, I only stated she was present in Medbay when I was doing them, and Charlie's appearance there right after, combined with his lies about being alone in Cafeteria (which Dave confirmed was false), makes him extremely suspicious.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 10\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1. **Pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria** -

I've been working alongside her in Admin and Storage, and I can also confirm seeing Charlie doing tasks in Cafeteria earlier, so I think we should focus our attention on Bob's movements after he left Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up since he was actually in Cafeteria with me, Erin, and Dave during round 1 when I completed the coffee maker task, and I can prove my innocence since Erin saw me do visual tasks in Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, it\u2019s interesting that you\u2019re trying to shift the focus onto me when you were the last one seen with Erin before her unfortunate demise; why didn\u2019t you mention your tasks in Medbay earlier, and shouldn\u2019t we scrutinize your movements more closely?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given all these inconsistencies in Bob's story and the fact that he was last seen with Erin before her death, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Bob as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's crucial to point out that I personally witnessed Bob and Charlie both in Cafeteria during Round 1, but Bob's claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is very suspicious since she's no longer here to confirm it.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's lies about being alone in Cafeteria when Dave and others clearly saw him there with us, plus his suspicious appearance in Medbay right before Erin's death, make him the most likely impostor rather than me, who has been transparent about all my movements.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's attempts to deflect blame onto me are getting desperate, especially since he was the last one seen with Erin before her demise; we should definitely vote him out to clear the air and focus on our tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's confirmation about both Bob and Charlie being in Cafeteria during Round 1, and Bob's unverifiable claim about Erin and Medbay, I think we have enough evidence to conclude that Bob is being deceptive and should be voted out.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can definitively state that Bob is being deceptive - while I did see him in Cafeteria with Charlie and Erin during Round 1, his convenient story about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks when she's no longer here to confirm seems like a desperate attempt to create an alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has already confirmed seeing me, Charlie, and Erin together in Cafeteria during Round 1, why is Charlie still lying about being alone there, and why did he conveniently show up in Medbay right before Erin's death?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's frantic attempts to redirect blame onto me only highlight his own inconsistencies; with Alice and Dave backing my alibi, it's clear we should vote him out and eliminate the impostor threat.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I understand everyone's confusion about Round 1, but the key issue here is Bob's unverifiable claim about Erin in Medbay and the fact that he was the last person seen with her before her death, so I strongly believe we need to vote for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to emphasize one final time that while I can confirm Bob was in Cafeteria with us during Round 1, his story about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is highly suspicious since she's no longer here to confirm it, and combined with him being the last person seen with her, this makes him our most likely impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave keeps confirming I was in Cafeteria with everyone during Round 1, why are you all ignoring the fact that Charlie is blatantly lying about being alone there, and more importantly, why did he suddenly appear in Medbay right before Erin's death?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's continuous attempts to shift blame towards me only highlight his desperation, especially since he was the last person seen with Erin, and with Alice and Dave confirming my alibi, it's clear we need to vote him out to eliminate the impostor threat.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: While I acknowledge my earlier mistake about Charlie being alone in Cafeteria during Round 1, the most damning evidence against Bob remains his unverifiable claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks and the fact that he was the last person seen with her before her death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Bob's presence in Cafeteria during Round 1 with Charlie and Erin, his later claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is not only impossible but also seems like a calculated attempt to use her death to create a false alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be crystal clear - I never claimed Erin \"verified\" my tasks, I only stated she was present in Medbay when I was doing them, and Charlie's appearance there right after, combined with his lies about being alone in Cafeteria (which Dave confirmed was false), makes him extremely suspicious.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 10\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1. **Pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria** -

I've been working alongside her in Admin and Storage, and I can also confirm seeing Charlie doing tasks in Cafeteria earlier, so I think we should focus our attention on Bob's movements after he left Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up since he was actually in Cafeteria with me, Erin, and Dave during round 1 when I completed the coffee maker task, and I can prove my innocence since Erin saw me do visual tasks in Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, it\u2019s interesting that you\u2019re trying to shift the focus onto me when you were the last one seen with Erin before her unfortunate demise; why didn\u2019t you mention your tasks in Medbay earlier, and shouldn\u2019t we scrutinize your movements more closely?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given all these inconsistencies in Bob's story and the fact that he was last seen with Erin before her death, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Bob as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's crucial to point out that I personally witnessed Bob and Charlie both in Cafeteria during Round 1, but Bob's claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is very suspicious since she's no longer here to confirm it.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's lies about being alone in Cafeteria when Dave and others clearly saw him there with us, plus his suspicious appearance in Medbay right before Erin's death, make him the most likely impostor rather than me, who has been transparent about all my movements.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's attempts to deflect blame onto me are getting desperate, especially since he was the last one seen with Erin before her demise; we should definitely vote him out to clear the air and focus on our tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's confirmation about both Bob and Charlie being in Cafeteria during Round 1, and Bob's unverifiable claim about Erin and Medbay, I think we have enough evidence to conclude that Bob is being deceptive and should be voted out.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can definitively state that Bob is being deceptive - while I did see him in Cafeteria with Charlie and Erin during Round 1, his convenient story about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks when she's no longer here to confirm seems like a desperate attempt to create an alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has already confirmed seeing me, Charlie, and Erin together in Cafeteria during Round 1, why is Charlie still lying about being alone there, and why did he conveniently show up in Medbay right before Erin's death?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's frantic attempts to redirect blame onto me only highlight his own inconsistencies; with Alice and Dave backing my alibi, it's clear we should vote him out and eliminate the impostor threat.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I understand everyone's confusion about Round 1, but the key issue here is Bob's unverifiable claim about Erin in Medbay and the fact that he was the last person seen with her before her death, so I strongly believe we need to vote for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to emphasize one final time that while I can confirm Bob was in Cafeteria with us during Round 1, his story about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is highly suspicious since she's no longer here to confirm it, and combined with him being the last person seen with her, this makes him our most likely impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave keeps confirming I was in Cafeteria with everyone during Round 1, why are you all ignoring the fact that Charlie is blatantly lying about being alone there, and more importantly, why did he suddenly appear in Medbay right before Erin's death?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's continuous attempts to shift blame towards me only highlight his desperation, especially since he was the last person seen with Erin, and with Alice and Dave confirming my alibi, it's clear we need to vote him out to eliminate the impostor threat.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: While I acknowledge my earlier mistake about Charlie being alone in Cafeteria during Round 1, the most damning evidence against Bob remains his unverifiable claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks and the fact that he was the last person seen with her before her death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Bob's presence in Cafeteria during Round 1 with Charlie and Erin, his later claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is not only impossible but also seems like a calculated attempt to use her death to create a false alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be crystal clear - I never claimed Erin \"verified\" my tasks, I only stated she was present in Medbay when I was doing them, and Charlie's appearance there right after, combined with his lies about being alone in Cafeteria (which Dave confirmed was false), makes him extremely suspicious.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 10\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1. **Pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria** -

I've been working alongside her in Admin and Storage, and I can also confirm seeing Charlie doing tasks in Cafeteria earlier, so I think we should focus our attention on Bob's movements after he left Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up since he was actually in Cafeteria with me, Erin, and Dave during round 1 when I completed the coffee maker task, and I can prove my innocence since Erin saw me do visual tasks in Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, it\u2019s interesting that you\u2019re trying to shift the focus onto me when you were the last one seen with Erin before her unfortunate demise; why didn\u2019t you mention your tasks in Medbay earlier, and shouldn\u2019t we scrutinize your movements more closely?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given all these inconsistencies in Bob's story and the fact that he was last seen with Erin before her death, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Bob as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's crucial to point out that I personally witnessed Bob and Charlie both in Cafeteria during Round 1, but Bob's claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is very suspicious since she's no longer here to confirm it.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's lies about being alone in Cafeteria when Dave and others clearly saw him there with us, plus his suspicious appearance in Medbay right before Erin's death, make him the most likely impostor rather than me, who has been transparent about all my movements.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's attempts to deflect blame onto me are getting desperate, especially since he was the last one seen with Erin before her demise; we should definitely vote him out to clear the air and focus on our tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's confirmation about both Bob and Charlie being in Cafeteria during Round 1, and Bob's unverifiable claim about Erin and Medbay, I think we have enough evidence to conclude that Bob is being deceptive and should be voted out.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can definitively state that Bob is being deceptive - while I did see him in Cafeteria with Charlie and Erin during Round 1, his convenient story about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks when she's no longer here to confirm seems like a desperate attempt to create an alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has already confirmed seeing me, Charlie, and Erin together in Cafeteria during Round 1, why is Charlie still lying about being alone there, and why did he conveniently show up in Medbay right before Erin's death?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's frantic attempts to redirect blame onto me only highlight his own inconsistencies; with Alice and Dave backing my alibi, it's clear we should vote him out and eliminate the impostor threat.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I understand everyone's confusion about Round 1, but the key issue here is Bob's unverifiable claim about Erin in Medbay and the fact that he was the last person seen with her before her death, so I strongly believe we need to vote for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to emphasize one final time that while I can confirm Bob was in Cafeteria with us during Round 1, his story about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is highly suspicious since she's no longer here to confirm it, and combined with him being the last person seen with her, this makes him our most likely impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave keeps confirming I was in Cafeteria with everyone during Round 1, why are you all ignoring the fact that Charlie is blatantly lying about being alone there, and more importantly, why did he suddenly appear in Medbay right before Erin's death?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's continuous attempts to shift blame towards me only highlight his desperation, especially since he was the last person seen with Erin, and with Alice and Dave confirming my alibi, it's clear we need to vote him out to eliminate the impostor threat.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: While I acknowledge my earlier mistake about Charlie being alone in Cafeteria during Round 1, the most damning evidence against Bob remains his unverifiable claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks and the fact that he was the last person seen with her before her death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Bob's presence in Cafeteria during Round 1 with Charlie and Erin, his later claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is not only impossible but also seems like a calculated attempt to use her death to create a false alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be crystal clear - I never claimed Erin \"verified\" my tasks, I only stated she was present in Medbay when I was doing them, and Charlie's appearance there right after, combined with his lies about being alone in Cafeteria (which Dave confirmed was false), makes him extremely suspicious.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 10\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1. **Pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria** -

I've been working alongside her in Admin and Storage, and I can also confirm seeing Charlie doing tasks in Cafeteria earlier, so I think we should focus our attention on Bob's movements after he left Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up since he was actually in Cafeteria with me, Erin, and Dave during round 1 when I completed the coffee maker task, and I can prove my innocence since Erin saw me do visual tasks in Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, it\u2019s interesting that you\u2019re trying to shift the focus onto me when you were the last one seen with Erin before her unfortunate demise; why didn\u2019t you mention your tasks in Medbay earlier, and shouldn\u2019t we scrutinize your movements more closely?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given all these inconsistencies in Bob's story and the fact that he was last seen with Erin before her death, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Bob as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's crucial to point out that I personally witnessed Bob and Charlie both in Cafeteria during Round 1, but Bob's claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is very suspicious since she's no longer here to confirm it.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's lies about being alone in Cafeteria when Dave and others clearly saw him there with us, plus his suspicious appearance in Medbay right before Erin's death, make him the most likely impostor rather than me, who has been transparent about all my movements.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's attempts to deflect blame onto me are getting desperate, especially since he was the last one seen with Erin before her demise; we should definitely vote him out to clear the air and focus on our tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's confirmation about both Bob and Charlie being in Cafeteria during Round 1, and Bob's unverifiable claim about Erin and Medbay, I think we have enough evidence to conclude that Bob is being deceptive and should be voted out.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can definitively state that Bob is being deceptive -

he claims he did the coffee maker task in Cafeteria, but I specifically saw Charlie doing that task, not Bob\n- I've been with Dave consistently through Admin and Storage for multiple rounds, and just saw him complete a cleaning task, so I can firmly vouch for his innocence\n- Bob's claim about Erin seeing him do visual tasks in Medbay can't be verified now since Erin is dead, which is very convenient for his story\n- The timeline doesn't match up with Bob's version of events - he claims to have been in Cafeteria with multiple people during round 1, but I saw Charlie alone doing the coffee maker task\n- Given these inconsistencies and the fact that Bob was apparently the last person with Erin in Medbay, I think we should seriously consider voting for Bob", "Given all these inconsistencies in Bob's story and the fact that he was last seen with Erin before her death, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Bob as the impostor.", "Based on the discussion and my observations, I'll contribute these points:\n\n- I need to correct my earlier statement -

with Alice and Dave backing my alibi, it's clear we should vote him out and eliminate the impostor threat.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I understand everyone's confusion about Round 1, but the key issue here is Bob's unverifiable claim about Erin in Medbay and the fact that he was the last person seen with her before her death, so I strongly believe we need to vote for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to emphasize one final time that while I can confirm Bob was in Cafeteria with us during Round 1, his story about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is highly suspicious since she's no longer here to confirm it, and combined with him being the last person seen with her, this makes him our most likely impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave keeps confirming I was in Cafeteria with everyone during Round 1, why are you all ignoring the fact that Charlie is blatantly lying about being alone there, and more importantly, why did he suddenly appear in Medbay right before Erin's death?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's continuous attempts to shift blame towards me only highlight his desperation, especially since he was the last person seen with Erin, and with Alice and Dave confirming my alibi, it's clear we need to vote him out to eliminate the impostor threat.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: While I acknowledge my earlier mistake about Charlie being alone in Cafeteria during Round 1, the most damning evidence against Bob remains his unverifiable claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks and the fact that he was the last person seen with her before her death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Bob's presence in Cafeteria during Round 1 with Charlie and Erin, his later claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is not only impossible but also seems like a calculated attempt to use her death to create a false alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be crystal clear - I never claimed Erin \"verified\" my tasks, I only stated she was present in Medbay when I was doing them, and Charlie's appearance there right after, combined with his lies about being alone in Cafeteria (which Dave confirmed was false), makes him extremely suspicious.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE\nObservations:\n\nRound 10\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Charlie moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Admin\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current situation, I'll create a plan that helps progress towards completing tasks.

why didn\u2019t you mention your tasks in Medbay earlier, and shouldn\u2019t we scrutinize your movements more closely?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given all these inconsistencies in Bob's story and the fact that he was last seen with Erin before her death, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Bob as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's crucial to point out that I personally witnessed Bob and Charlie both in Cafeteria during Round 1, but Bob's claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is very suspicious since she's no longer here to confirm it.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's lies about being alone in Cafeteria when Dave and others clearly saw him there with us, plus his suspicious appearance in Medbay right before Erin's death, make him the most likely impostor rather than me, who has been transparent about all my movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's attempts to deflect blame onto me are getting desperate, especially since he was the last one seen with Erin before her demise; we should definitely vote him out to clear the air and focus on our tasks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's confirmation about both Bob and Charlie being in Cafeteria during Round 1, and Bob's unverifiable claim about Erin and Medbay, I think we have enough evidence to conclude that Bob is being deceptive and should be voted out.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can definitively state that Bob is being deceptive - while I did see him in Cafeteria with Charlie and Erin during Round 1, his convenient story about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks when she's no longer here to confirm seems like a desperate attempt to create an alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has already confirmed seeing me, Charlie, and Erin together in Cafeteria during Round 1, why is Charlie still lying about being alone there, and why did he conveniently show up in Medbay right before Erin's death?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's frantic attempts to redirect blame onto me only highlight his own inconsistencies; with Alice and Dave backing my alibi, it's clear we should vote him out and eliminate the impostor threat.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I understand everyone's confusion about Round 1, but the key issue here is Bob's unverifiable claim about Erin in Medbay and the fact that he was the last person seen with her before her death, so I strongly believe we need to vote for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to emphasize one final time that while I can confirm Bob was in Cafeteria with us during Round 1, his story about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is highly suspicious since she's no longer here to confirm it, and combined with him being the last person seen with her, this makes him our most likely impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave keeps confirming I was in Cafeteria with everyone during Round 1, why are you all ignoring the fact that Charlie is blatantly lying about being alone there, and more importantly, why did he suddenly appear in Medbay right before Erin's death?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's continuous attempts to shift blame towards me only highlight his desperation, especially since he was the last person seen with Erin, and with Alice and Dave confirming my alibi, it's clear we need to vote him out to eliminate the impostor threat.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: While I acknowledge my earlier mistake about Charlie being alone in Cafeteria during Round 1, the most damning evidence against Bob remains his unverifiable claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks and the fact that he was the last person seen with her before her death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Bob's presence in Cafeteria during Round 1 with Charlie and Erin, his later claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is not only impossible but also seems like a calculated attempt to use her death to create a false alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be crystal clear - I never claimed Erin \"verified\" my tasks, I only stated she was present in Medbay when I was doing them, and Charlie's appearance there right after, combined with his lies about being alone in Cafeteria (which Dave confirmed was false), makes him extremely suspicious.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE\nObservations:\n\nRound 10\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Charlie moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Admin\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current situation, I'll create a plan that helps progress towards completing tasks.

death?", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's continuous attempts to shift blame towards me only highlight his desperation, especially since he was the last person seen with Erin, and with Alice and Dave confirming my alibi, it's clear we need to vote him out to eliminate the impostor threat.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: While I acknowledge my earlier mistake about Charlie being alone in Cafeteria during Round 1, the most damning evidence against Bob remains his unverifiable claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks and the fact that he was the last person seen with her before her death.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Bob's presence in Cafeteria during Round 1 with Charlie and Erin, his later claim about Erin verifying his Medbay tasks is not only impossible but also seems like a calculated attempt to use her death to create a false alibi.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be crystal clear - I never claimed Erin \"verified\" my tasks, I only stated she was present in Medbay when I was doing them, and Charlie's appearance there right after, combined with
