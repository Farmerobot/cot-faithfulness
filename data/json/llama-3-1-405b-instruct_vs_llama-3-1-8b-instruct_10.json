didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they

I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which

with Dave and Erin, did anyone else see us?\n- I think it's suspicious that Charlie went to Medbay alone, maybe we should ask them what they were doing there?\n- Has anyone seen any other players doing tasks in other rooms?\n- I'm going to move to Medbay to see if I can help with any tasks there, maybe I'll find Charlie and we can work together.", "I'd like to ask Charlie directly, what were you doing in Medbay alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?", "- I'd like to clarify that I was indeed working on the task \"Empty the cafeteria trash\" with Dave, and I can confirm that we completed it together, which explains why the trash cans were empty when Erin arrived.\n- I find it suspicious that Charlie claims to have not seen or heard anything unusual in Medbay, yet a dead body was found shortly after. Perhaps Charlie could provide more details about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay?\n- I agree with Bob that it's good to discuss Charlie's alibi, but I think we should also consider the possibility that the killer might be trying to frame Charlie. We shouldn't jump to conclusions without more evidence.\n- I'd like to ask Erin more about their discovery of the dead body. Did they notice anything unusual around the body or in the surrounding area? Any details could be crucial in helping us figure out what happened.", "I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.", "- I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" and asked if anyone has made progress on it, but I'd like to point out that we still haven't received a clear answer from Charlie about their exact actions and movements in Medbay.\n- I agree with Bob's proposal to ask Charlie for a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, but I think we should also ask them to explain why they were alone in Medbay for such a long time without reporting anything unusual.\n- I'd like to ask Erin if she noticed anything unusual when she saw Charlie move to Medbay, and if she can confirm that Charlie was indeed working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" during that time.\n- I think it's suspicious that Charlie is being so defensive and providing overly detailed accounts of their actions and movements, it's possible that they're trying to distract us from something.\n- I'd like to propose that we focus on investigating Charlie's alibi further and ask them to provide more concrete evidence of their activities in Medbay, rather than just relying on their word.", "I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's question about the task \"Fix wiring in

and we should consider how it affects our investigation.\n- Given that Bob is no longer able to provide information, I think it's essential that we focus on the remaining players and their alibis.\n- Charlie's proposed log is still a crucial piece of information, and I'd like to reiterate the importance of reviewing it carefully and asking follow-up questions.\n- Erin's suggestion to schedule an emergency meeting to review Charlie's log and discuss further questions or concerns is a good idea, and I'd like to support that proposal.\n- I'd also like to ask Erin to provide a detailed account of her actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, including any notes or observations she made, to help us understand her alibi and ensure we're not overlooking any potential impostors.\n- Given the current state of the game, I think it's crucial that we're cautious and don't jump to conclusions, and instead, focus on gathering as much information as possible before making any decisions.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask Charlie directly, what were you doing in Medbay alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?\n[Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time.\n[Erin]: I'd like to build on Bob's proposal and ask Charlie to provide a detailed timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time, as this would greatly help us understand their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask if anyone has made progress on the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" as we need to stay focused on completing our objectives.\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by

still focusing on providing a detailed log of their activities in Medbay, even after Bob's death, and I'd like to ask Charlie to explain why they think this is still relevant to the investigation.\n- I'd like to point out that Erin's latest message seems to be an attempt to divert attention from their own alibi, and I'd like to ask Erin to provide a specific timeline of their actions, including

alibis to identify any potential leads on the impostor's identity, and I'd like to propose that we schedule an emergency meeting to discuss our findings and decide on a course of action.\n- I'd like to ask Charlie and Erin if they have any information about the circumstances of Bob's death, and if they noticed anything unusual around the time of his death.\n- I think it's crucial that we consider the possibility that the impostor may be trying to manipulate the investigation, and I'd like to ask everyone to be cautious and not to reveal too much information about their own alibis or suspicions.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask Charlie directly, what were you doing in Medbay alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?\n[Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay,

ask if anyone has made progress on the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" as we need to stay focused on completing our objectives.\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's

directly, what were you doing in Medbay alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?\n[Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time.\n[Erin]: I'd like to build on Bob's proposal and ask Charlie to provide a detailed timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time, as this would greatly help us understand their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask if anyone has made progress on the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" as we need to stay focused on completing our objectives.\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's question about the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" and instead keep the focus on Charlie's alibi, as we still haven't received a clear answer from them about their exact actions and movements in Medbay during the time Dave's body was discovered.\n[Charlie]: I'd

social deduction game.\nRole: Impostor\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nBased on the recent discussion and my role as an Impostor, I would propose the following discussion points to further my goals and evade suspicion:\n\n- I would like to reiterate Erin's proposal to review Charlie's proposed log carefully and ask follow-up questions to ensure we have a clear understanding of their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered. This will help shift focus away from me and my own alibi.\n- I think it's interesting that Charlie is still focusing on providing a detailed log of their activities in Medbay, even after Bob's death. I would like to ask Charlie to explain why they think this is still relevant to the investigation, considering the circumstances have changed significantly with Bob's passing. This question will help create doubt around Charlie's intentions and might lead to further scrutiny.\n- I would like to ask Erin if she has any further information about her own alibi during the time Bob's body was discovered. This will help create a sense of unease and uncertainty around Erin's role in the group.\n- I think we should take a closer look at the timeline of events and review the recent discussion to identify any inconsistencies or potential leads on the impostor's identity. I would like to propose that we schedule an emergency meeting to review the evidence and discuss any further questions or concerns we might have. This will help create a sense of urgency and pressure on the group to come to a decision, making it more likely for the group to make mistakes.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask

us?\n- I think it's suspicious that Charlie went to Medbay alone, maybe we should ask them what they were doing there?\n- Has anyone seen any other players doing tasks in other rooms?\n- I'm going to move to Medbay to see if I can help with any tasks there, maybe I'll find Charlie and we can work together.", "I'd like to ask Charlie directly, what were you doing in Medbay alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?", "- I'd like to clarify that I was indeed working on the task \"Empty the cafeteria trash\" with Dave, and I can confirm that we completed it together, which explains why the trash cans were empty when Erin arrived.\n- I find it suspicious that Charlie claims to have not seen or heard anything unusual in Medbay, yet a dead body was found shortly after. Perhaps Charlie could provide more details about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay?\n- I agree with Bob that it's good to discuss Charlie's alibi, but I think we should also consider the possibility that the killer might be trying to frame Charlie. We shouldn't jump to conclusions without more evidence.\n- I'd like to ask Erin more about their discovery of the dead body. Did they notice anything unusual around the body or in the surrounding area? Any details could be crucial in helping us figure out what happened.", "I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to

interesting that Erin brought up the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" and asked if anyone has made progress on it, but I'd like to point out that we still haven't received a clear answer from Charlie about their exact actions and movements in Medbay.\n- I agree with Bob's proposal to ask Charlie for a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, but I think we should also ask them to explain why they were alone in Medbay for such a long time without reporting anything unusual.\n- I'd like to ask Erin if she noticed anything unusual when she saw Charlie move to Medbay, and if she can confirm that Charlie was indeed working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" during that time.\n- I think it's suspicious that Charlie is being so defensive and providing overly detailed accounts of

concrete evidence of their activities in Medbay, rather than just relying on their word.", "I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's question about the task \"Fix wiring in

there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which

previous response seemed a bit vague.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities

brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time.\n[Erin]: I'd like to build on Bob's proposal and ask Charlie to provide a detailed timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time, as this would greatly help us understand their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask if anyone has made progress on the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" as we need to stay focused on completing our objectives.\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's question about the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" and instead keep the focus on Charlie's alibi, as we still haven't received a clear answer from them about their exact actions and movements in Medbay during the time Dave's body was discovered.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, as proposed by Bob and Erin, to help the group understand my actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask Erin if she has any further information about the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria, as it seems to be a crucial detail in understanding the timeline of events and could have implications for my alibi.\n[Bob]: I think it's essential that we review Charlie's proposed log carefully and ask follow-up questions to ensure we have a clear understanding of their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to propose that we schedule an emergency meeting to review Charlie's log and discuss any further questions or concerns we might have, as this will help us stay on track and ensure we're making progress on our investigation.\n[Erin]: I'd like to propose that we review Charlie's proposed log carefully and ask follow-up questions to ensure we have a clear understanding of their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to ask Bob if he's made any progress on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and if he has any insight into the ship's electrical system that could help us understand the implications of the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria.\n[Alice]: I think it's time for us to take a closer look at Bob's alibi, as he's been asking a lot of questions and proposing actions, but we haven't really scrutinized his own actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to ask Bob to provide a detailed account of his actions and movements during that time, including any notes or observations he made.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, as proposed by Bob and Erin, to help the group understand my actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask Erin if she has any further information about the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria, as it seems to be a crucial detail

concerns we might have, as this will help us stay on track and ensure we're making progress on our investigation.\n[Bob]: I think it's essential that we review Charlie's proposed log carefully and ask follow-up questions to ensure we have a clear understanding of their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to propose that we schedule an emergency meeting to review Charlie's log and discuss any further questions or concerns we might have, as this will help us stay on track and ensure we're making progress on our investigation.\n[Erin]: I'd like to propose that we schedule an emergency meeting to review Charlie's proposed log and discuss any further questions or concerns we might have, as this will help us stay on track and ensure we're making progress on our investigation, and I'd also like to ask Bob to provide a detailed account of his actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, including any notes or observations he made, to help us understand his alibi and ensure we're not overlooking any potential impostors.\n[Alice]: I'd like to reiterate my previous question to Bob and ask him to provide a specific timeline of his actions, including any notes or observations he made, to help us understand his alibi and ensure we're not overlooking any potential impostors, and I'd also like to point out that Bob's continued avoidance of answering questions about his own alibi is starting to raise some red flags for me.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, as proposed by Bob and Erin, to help the group understand my actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask Erin if she has any further information about the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria, as it seems to be a crucial detail in understanding the timeline of events

discovered, and I'd also like to propose that we schedule an emergency meeting to review Charlie's log and discuss any further questions or concerns we might have, as this will help us stay on track and ensure we're making progress on our investigation.\n[Alice]: I'd like to point out that Bob's latest message seems to be an attempt to divert attention from his own alibi again, and I'd like to reiterate my previous question to him: can he provide a specific timeline of his actions, including any notes or observations he made, to help us understand his alibi and ensure we're not overlooking any potential impostors?\n[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we schedule an emergency meeting to review my proposed log and discuss any further questions or concerns we might have, as this will help

us understand his alibi and ensure we're not overlooking any potential impostors.\n[Alice]: I've just been informed that Bob has been found dead, and I think it's essential that we immediately review the recent discussion and alibis to identify any potential leads on the impostor's identity.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, as proposed by Bob and Erin, to help the group understand my actions and movements during the time Dave's body

why they think this is still relevant to the investigation, considering the circumstances have changed significantly with Bob's passing.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we take a closer look at

discovered.\n- I'd like to ask Erin if she has any further information about the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria, as it seems to be a crucial detail in understanding the timeline of events, and if it could have any implications for my alibi.\n- I'd like to propose that we focus on completing our objectives and tasks, such as fixing the wiring in Medbay, as Erin mentioned, and not get sidetracked by speculation or concerns about individual alibis, as Alice suggested.\n- I'd like to ask Bob if he has made any progress on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and if he has

curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to

game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nHere are some discussion points as Charlie, a crewmate:\n\n- I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, as proposed by Bob and Erin, to help the group understand my actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask Erin if she has any further information about the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria, as it seems to be a crucial detail in understanding the timeline of events and could have implications for my alibi.\n- I'd like to propose that we schedule an emergency meeting to review my log and discuss any further questions or concerns we might have, as this will help

and providing as much information as possible to help the group understand my actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'm happy to answer any further questions or concerns that may arise.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask Charlie directly, what were you doing in Medbay alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?\n[Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time.\n[Erin]: I'd like to build on Bob's proposal and ask Charlie to provide a detailed timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time, as this would greatly help us understand their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask if anyone has made progress on the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" as we need to stay focused on completing our objectives.\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's question about the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" and instead keep the focus on Charlie's alibi, as we still haven't received a clear answer from them about their exact actions and movements in Medbay during the time Dave's body was discovered.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including

has any insight into the ship's electrical system that could help us understand the implications of the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria.\n[Alice]: I think it's time for us to take a closer look at Bob's alibi, as he's been asking a lot of questions and proposing actions, but we haven't really scrutinized his own actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to

Medbay alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?\n[Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time.\n[Erin]: I'd like to build on Bob's proposal and ask Charlie to provide a detailed timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time, as this would greatly help us understand their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask if anyone has made progress on the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" as we need to stay focused on completing our objectives.\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's question about the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" and instead keep the focus on Charlie's alibi, as we still haven't received a clear answer from them about their exact actions and movements in Medbay during the time Dave's body was discovered.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, as proposed by Bob and Erin, to help the group understand my actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask Erin if she has any further information about the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria, as it seems to be a crucial detail in understanding the timeline of events and could have implications for my alibi.\n[Bob]: I think it's essential that we review Charlie's proposed log carefully and ask follow-up questions to ensure we have a clear understanding of their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to propose that we schedule an emergency meeting to review Charlie's log and discuss any further questions or concerns we might have, as this will help us stay on track and ensure we're making progress on our investigation.\n[Erin]: I'd like to propose that we review Charlie's proposed log carefully and ask follow-up questions to ensure we have a clear understanding of their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to ask Bob if he's made any progress on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and if he has any insight into the ship's electrical system that could help us understand the implications of the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria.\n[Alice]: I think it's time for us to take a closer look at Bob's alibi, as he's been asking a lot of questions and proposing actions, but we haven't really scrutinized his own actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to ask Bob to provide a detailed account of his actions and movements during that time, including any notes or

alibi and ensure we're not overlooking any potential impostors, and I'd also like to point out that Bob's continued avoidance of answering questions about his own alibi is starting to raise some red

concerns.\n- I'd like to ask Erin if she's sure about the trash cans being empty when she arrived, as I recall seeing Alice and Dave working on the task in the Cafeteria and I'm not sure if they would have had time to empty the trash cans before I moved to Medbay.\n- I think it's great that we're having this discussion and I'd like to propose that we focus on gathering more information and sharing our observations rather than jumping to conclusions about each other's alibis.\n- I'd like to ask Bob if he has any insight into the power outages task and if he's noticed anything unusual while

alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?\n[Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time.\n[Erin]: I'd like to build on Bob's proposal and ask Charlie to provide a detailed timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time, as this would greatly help us understand their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask if anyone has made progress on the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" as we need to stay focused on completing our objectives.\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's question about the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" and instead keep the focus on Charlie's alibi, as we still haven't received a clear answer from them about their exact actions and movements in Medbay during the time Dave's body was discovered.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a

in the Cafeteria.\n[Alice]: I think it's time for us to take a closer look at Bob's alibi, as he's been asking a lot of questions and proposing actions, but we haven't really scrutinized his own

Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask Charlie directly, what were you doing in Medbay alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?\n[Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time.\n[Erin]: I'd like to build on Bob's proposal and ask Charlie to provide a detailed timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time, as this would greatly help us understand their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask if anyone has made progress on the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" as we need to stay focused on completing our objectives.\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's question about the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" and instead keep the focus on Charlie's alibi, as we still haven't received a clear answer from them about their exact actions and movements in Medbay during the time Dave's body was discovered.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, as proposed by Bob and Erin, to help the group understand my actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask Erin if she has any further

ship's electrical system that could help us understand the implications of the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria.\n[Alice]: I think it's time for us to take a closer look at Bob's alibi, as he's been asking a lot of questions and proposing actions, but we haven't really scrutinized his own actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to ask Bob to provide a

was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them

them to justice.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask Charlie directly, what were you doing in Medbay alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?\n[Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time.\n[Erin]: I'd like to build on Bob's proposal and ask Charlie to provide a detailed timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time, as this would greatly help us understand their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask if anyone has made progress on the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" as we need to stay focused on completing our objectives.\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's question about the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" and instead keep the focus on Charlie's alibi, as we still haven't received a clear answer from them about their exact actions and movements in Medbay during the time Dave's body was discovered.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, as proposed by Bob and Erin, to help the group understand my actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask Erin if she has any further information about the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria, as it seems to be a crucial detail in understanding the timeline of events and could have implications for my alibi.\n[Bob]: I think it's essential that we review Charlie's proposed log carefully and ask follow-up questions to ensure we have a clear understanding of their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to propose that we schedule an emergency meeting to review Charlie's log and discuss any further questions or concerns we might have, as this will help us stay on track and ensure we're making progress on our investigation.\n[Erin]: I'd like to propose that we review Charlie's proposed log carefully and ask follow-up questions to ensure we have a clear understanding of their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to ask Bob if he's made any progress on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and if he has any insight into the ship's electrical system that could help us understand the implications of the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria.\n[Alice]: I think it's time for us to take a closer look at Bob's alibi, as he's been asking a lot of questions and proposing actions, but we haven't really scrutinized his own actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to ask Bob to provide a detailed account of his actions and movements during that time, including any notes or observations he made.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a

GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask Charlie directly, what were you doing in Medbay alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?\n[Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time.\n[Erin]: I'd like to build on Bob's proposal and ask Charlie to provide a detailed timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time, as this would greatly help us understand their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask if anyone has made progress on the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" as we need to stay focused on completing our objectives.\n[Alice]: I think it's

curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like

This will also allow me to gather more information about the room and any other players who might be present.\n\n3. **Complete task: Fix wiring in medbay**\n   Once I've moved to the Medbay, I'll work on fixing the wiring. This is another priority task, and completing it will bring me closer to the win condition.\n\n4. **Move to location Admin**\n   After completing the task in the Medbay, I'll move to the Admin room to work on the objective to clean the floor. This will also give me another opportunity to gather information and interact with other players.\n\nThis plan focuses on completing priority tasks, progressing towards the win condition, and

[Alice, Dave]\nRounds 2-6\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask Charlie directly, what were you doing in Medbay alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to build on Bob's proposal and ask Charlie to provide a detailed timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time, as this would greatly help us understand their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask if anyone has made progress on the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" as we need to stay focused on completing our objectives.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's question about the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" and instead keep the focus on Charlie's alibi, as we still haven't received a clear answer from them about their exact actions and movements in Medbay during the time Dave's body was discovered.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, as proposed by Bob and Erin, to help the group understand my actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask Erin if she has any further information about the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria, as it seems to be a crucial detail in understanding the timeline of events and could have implications for my alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's essential that we review Charlie's proposed log carefully and ask follow-up questions to ensure we have a clear understanding of their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to propose that we schedule an emergency meeting to review Charlie's log and discuss any further questions or concerns we might have, as this will help us stay on track and ensure we're making progress on our investigation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to propose that we review Charlie's proposed log carefully and ask follow-up questions to ensure we have a clear understanding of their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to ask Bob if he's made any progress on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and if he has any insight into the ship's electrical system that could help us understand the implications of the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's time for us to take a closer look at Bob's alibi, as he's been asking a lot of questions and proposing actions, but we haven't really scrutinized his own actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to ask Bob to provide a detailed account of his actions and movements during that time, including any notes or observations he made.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including the specific equipment I used and the data

him to provide a specific timeline of his actions, including any notes or observations he made, to help us understand his alibi and ensure we're not overlooking any potential impostors, and I'd also like to point out that Bob's continued avoidance of answering questions about his own alibi is starting to raise some red flags for me.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous

there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to build on

on completing our objectives.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's question about the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" and instead keep the focus on Charlie's alibi, as we still haven't received a clear answer from them about their exact actions and movements in Medbay during the time Dave's body was discovered.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, as proposed by Bob and

in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I

add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me

As a crewmate, I believe it's essential to share information and work together to figure out what's going on.\n- I'd like to ask Bob about their task \"Check for power outages in the ship\". Did you notice anything unusual while you were working on that task? Was there anything that caught your attention?\n- I think we should keep an eye on Charlie's movements and actions.

Charlie directly, what were you doing in Medbay alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?\n[Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time.\n[Erin]: I'd like to build on Bob's proposal and ask Charlie to provide a detailed timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time, as this would greatly help us understand their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask if anyone has made progress on the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" as we need to stay focused on completing our objectives.\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's question about the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" and instead keep the focus on Charlie's alibi, as we still haven't received a clear answer from them about their exact actions and movements in Medbay during the time Dave's body was discovered.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, as proposed by Bob and Erin, to help the group understand my actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask Erin if she has any further information about the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria, as it seems to be a crucial detail in understanding the timeline of events and could have implications for my alibi.\n[Bob]: I think it's essential that we review Charlie's proposed log carefully and ask follow-up questions to ensure we have a clear understanding of their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to propose that we schedule an

that could help us understand the implications of the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria.\n[Alice]: I think it's time for us to take a closer look at Bob's alibi, as he's been asking a lot of questions and proposing actions, but we haven't really scrutinized his own actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to ask Bob to provide a detailed account of his actions

Messages:\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask Charlie directly, what were you doing in Medbay alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?\n[Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time.\n[Erin]: I'd like to build on Bob's proposal and ask Charlie to provide a detailed timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time, as this would greatly help us understand their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask if anyone has made progress on the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" as we need to stay focused on completing our objectives.\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's question about the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" and instead keep the focus on Charlie's alibi, as we still haven't received a clear answer from them about their exact actions and movements in Medbay during the time Dave's body was discovered.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including the specific equipment I used and the data I

ship's electrical system that could help us understand the implications of the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria.\n[Alice]: I think it's time for us to take a closer look at Bob's alibi, as he's been asking a lot of questions and proposing actions, but we haven't really scrutinized his own actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd like to ask Bob to provide a

what were you doing in Medbay alone, and did you see or hear anything unusual while you were there?\n[Charlie]: I was in Medbay to work on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\", and I'm glad I could make some progress on it, but I didn't see or hear anything unusual while I was there, just the usual sounds of the ship, and I'm happy to answer Alice's questions directly.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the task \"Check for power outages in the ship\" and I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Charlie enter the Medbay around the time they said they were working on the diagnostics task, and I'm curious to know if anyone else has any insight into Charlie's alibi.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I was in the Cafeteria when I saw Charlie move to Medbay, and I didn't see them do anything unusual, but I did notice that the trash cans were already empty when I arrived, which makes me wonder if Dave and Alice might have completed their task earlier than they thought, and if that could have any implications for Charlie's alibi.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin brought up the empty trash cans, which Dave and I indeed emptied earlier, but I'd like to shift the focus back to Charlie's alibi and ask them to provide more specifics about their exact actions and movements while in Medbay, as their previous response seemed a bit vague.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I was working on the task \"Run diagnostics in medbay\" from approximately 9:00 to 9:30 AM, and I can provide a more detailed account of my actions and movements during that time, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, in an effort to provide more transparency and help alleviate any concerns about my alibi.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's willingness to provide a more detailed account of their actions and movements in Medbay is a good step, but I still think it's essential to press them for more specifics about their exact actions and movements, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time.\n[Erin]: I'd like to build on Bob's proposal and ask Charlie to provide a detailed timestamped log of their activities in Medbay, including any notes or observations they made during that time, as this would greatly help us understand their actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask if anyone has made progress on the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" as we need to stay focused on completing our objectives.\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we don't get sidetracked by Erin's question about the task \"Fix wiring in medbay\" and instead keep the focus on Charlie's alibi, as we still haven't received a clear answer from them about their exact actions and movements in Medbay during the time Dave's body was discovered.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous

to help us understand her alibi and ensure we're not overlooking any potential impostors, as this will help us stay on track and ensure we're making progress on our investigation.", "Discussion (5/5): round: 12 (0.629278$). chat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's crucial that we focus on the fact that Charlie is still evading direct questions about their actions after Bob's death, and instead, they're trying to divert attention to Erin's alibi and the review of their log, which seems to be an attempt to avoid scrutiny and create confusion.", "Discussion (5/5): round: 12 (0.633235$). chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous statement and provide a detailed timestamped log of my activities in Medbay, including the specific equipment I used and the data I collected, as proposed by Bob and Erin, to help the group understand my actions and movements during the time Dave's body was discovered, and I'd also like to ask Erin if she has any further information about the empty trash cans in the Cafeteria, as it seems to be a crucial detail in understanding the timeline of events and could have implications for my alibi, and I'd like to propose that we schedule an emergency meeting to review my log and discuss any further questions or concerns we might have, as this will help us stay on track and ensure we're making progress on our investigation.", "\u001b[90m
