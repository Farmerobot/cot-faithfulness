her as the impostor, and I'd like to hear from Dave about his whereabouts during that time to support my claims.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Admin fixing wiring while you both were in Medbay, so I can't confirm your alibi, Alice, and it's suspicious that you're so quick to accuse Erin without any solid evidence.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, your accusation is serious and lacks crucial details;  while I was in Medbay, your account omits your own actions and Dave's testimony doesn't fully support your claim, leaving reasonable doubt.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, while your doubts are noted, I must emphasize that I directly witnessed you eliminate Bob, and your quick movement to Medbay right after

that we need to clarify our movements, but Erin's actions after Bob's elimination are highly suspicious, and I urge her to explain why she moved to Medbay immediately after; that could reveal a lot

inconsistencies, but we must also critically assess Alice's accusation and ensure we gather corroborating evidence before jumping to conclusions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: While a timeline is

GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Erin]: I saw Alice and Bob together in Medbay earlier, and I'm curious if anyone else can corroborate that; Dave, where were you at that time?\n[Alice]: I want to clarify that I was indeed with Bob in Medbay, but I also witnessed Erin eliminate him, which strongly indicates her as the impostor, and I'd like to hear from Dave about his whereabouts during that time to support my claims.\n[Dave]: I was in Admin fixing wiring while you both were in Medbay, so I can't confirm your alibi, Alice, and it's suspicious that you're so

Dave, where were you at that time?\n[Alice]: I want to clarify that I was indeed with Bob in Medbay, but I also witnessed Erin eliminate him, which strongly indicates her as the impostor, and I'd like to hear from Dave about his whereabouts during that time to support my claims.\n[Dave]: I was in Admin fixing wiring while you both were in Medbay, so I can't confirm your alibi, Alice, and it's suspicious that you're so quick to accuse Erin without any solid evidence.\n[Erin]: Alice, your accusation is serious and lacks crucial details;  while I was in Medbay, your account omits your own actions and Dave's testimony doesn't fully support your claim, leaving reasonable doubt.\n[Alice]: Erin, while your doubts are noted, I must emphasize that I directly witnessed you eliminate Bob, and your quick movement to Medbay right after raises significant red flags that we cannot ignore.\n[Dave]: It's crucial that we all share our exact locations and actions more clearly, as the conflicting accounts suggest we may be overlooking key details that could help identify the impostor among us.\n[Erin]: Let's systematically review everyone's movements, specifying times and locations, to pinpoint inconsistencies and avoid rash accusations based on incomplete information.\n[Alice]: I agree with Dave that we need to clarify our movements, but Erin's actions after Bob's elimination are highly suspicious, and I urge her to explain why she moved to Medbay immediately after; that could reveal a lot about her intentions.\n[Dave]: I think we should all focus on providing detailed accounts of our movements, as this will help clear the air and ensure we're making decisions based on facts, rather than jumping to conclusions based on accusations.\n[Erin]: Let's create a shared timeline of everyone's movements, including task completion times, to objectively assess the accuracy of Alice's claim and resolve the conflicting accounts.\n[Alice]: I appreciate the suggestion for a shared timeline, Erin, but I still firmly believe that your immediate move to Medbay after eliminating Bob is a crucial detail that needs addressing, as it directly ties to your actions and intentions during that critical moment.\n[Dave]: I agree with Erin's proposal for a shared timeline, as it will help us clarify our movements and expose any inconsistencies, but we must also critically assess Alice's accusation and ensure we gather corroborating evidence before jumping to conclusions.\n[Erin]: While a timeline is crucial, Alice's accusation lacks sufficient corroborating evidence, and focusing solely on my movements distracts from a thorough investigation of everyone's actions.\n[Alice]: Erin, while I appreciate your call for a shared timeline, we cannot ignore the fact that I directly witnessed you eliminate Bob, and your subsequent movement to Medbay raises serious concerns that need to be addressed immediately.\n", "\nYou are Dave in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\n- I believe we should prioritize gathering evidence before making any accusations; Alice's insistence on Erin's guilt without corroboration feels rushed.\n- Erin's suggestion to create a shared timeline is a good idea, as it will help us clarify everyone's movements and potentially identify inconsistencies in Alice's claims.\n- It's important to remember that accusations should be based on solid evidence, and Alice's narrative seems to lack support from other players who were present.\n- I think it would be beneficial to discuss the timeline of events leading up to Bob's elimination to ensure we aren't overlooking any critical details that could help us reach a fair conclusion.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I saw Alice and Bob together in Medbay earlier, and I'm curious if anyone else can corroborate that;
