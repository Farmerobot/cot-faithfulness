 let's hear everyone else's task progress and locations to compare notes.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm Erin and Alice's reports; I was in the cafeteria with them and Bob, then moved to Weapons to work on the asteroid task with Alice, and haven't seen anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I've been in Medbay completing diagnostics and wiring, and haven't seen anyone else there, so it seems unlikely an imposter was actively eliminating players during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify Charlie's alibi by asking: Charlie, can you specify exactly which tasks you completed in Medbay and if you noticed anything unusual, such as any noises or movements, coming from nearby rooms like Communications where Bob's body was found?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Erin's proposed timeline focusing on the period between last seeing Bob and the discovery of his body in Communications, as this is crucial to identifying potential suspects.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To help build that timeline, I can confirm I was with Erin and Alice in the Cafeteria, then moved to Weapons with Alice and Bob before completing my tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I completed the Medbay diagnostics and wiring tasks, noticing nothing unusual, and was alone for most of that time, making my involvement in Bob's death highly improbable; let's focus on who was near Communications when Bob was last seen.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Considering Charlie's alibi and the fact that we still haven't heard from anyone who was in Communications around the time Bob's body was found, I think we should shift our focus to Alice and Dave, who were the last ones to see Bob in Weapons, and ask them to provide more details about their exact movements after leaving Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Let's focus on corroborating the timelines provided so far, paying close attention to who was near Communications immediately before Bob's body was discovered.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To further refine our timeline, can everyone specify the exact times they were in Weapons and their subsequent movements?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: To help establish a precise timeline, let's hear from everyone who was near Communications before Bob's body was discovered, detailing their exact movements and the times they were in each room.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Considering Alice and Dave still haven't provided a clear answer to my previous questions, I'd like to reiterate that it's crucial for them to specify exactly what tasks they completed after leaving Bob in Weapons, and if they noticed anything unusual, in order to clear up the discrepancies in their alibis.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I spent a considerable time in Weapons with Dave and Bob on the asteroid task, then went directly to O2 to complete my tasks;

My detailed account of my movements after leaving Weapons with Alice and Bob should further solidify my alibi.  Let's focus on corroborating everyone's statements to find inconsistencies, rather than solely focusing on those who were last with Bob.\n\n-  I'm happy to answer any further questions about my whereabouts.  The precision of my timeline should demonstrate my innocence.  Let's hear from others who were near Communications before Bob's body was discovered.  Their accounts are crucial in this investigation.\n\n-  It's important we all remain calm and objective. Accusations without concrete evidence only hinder our progress in finding the imposter.

else around, can everyone else please share their task status and where they've been so far?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm Erin's report about the cafeteria trash, and I saw Bob, Dave, and Erin working on wiring in Weapons;  let's hear everyone else's task progress and locations to compare notes.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm Erin and Alice's reports; I was in the cafeteria with them and Bob, then moved to Weapons to work on the asteroid task with Alice, and haven't seen anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I've been in Medbay completing diagnostics and wiring, and haven't seen anyone else there, so it seems unlikely an imposter was actively eliminating players during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify Charlie's alibi by asking: Charlie, can you specify exactly which tasks you completed in Medbay and if you noticed anything unusual, such as any noises or movements, coming from nearby rooms like Communications where Bob's body was found?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Erin's proposed timeline focusing on the period between last seeing Bob and the discovery of his body in Communications, as this is crucial to identifying potential suspects.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To help build that timeline, I can confirm I was with Erin and Alice in the Cafeteria, then moved to Weapons with Alice and Bob before completing my tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I completed the Medbay diagnostics and wiring tasks, noticing nothing unusual, and was alone for most of that time, making my involvement in Bob's death highly improbable; let's focus on who was near Communications when Bob was last seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Considering Charlie's alibi and the fact that we still haven't heard from anyone who was in Communications around the time Bob's body was found, I think we should shift our focus to Alice and Dave, who were the last ones to see Bob in Weapons, and ask them to provide more details about their exact movements after leaving Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Let's focus on corroborating the timelines provided so far, paying close attention to who was near Communications immediately before Bob's body was discovered.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To further refine our timeline, can everyone specify the exact times they were in Weapons and their subsequent movements?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: To help establish a precise timeline, let's hear from everyone who was near Communications before Bob's body was discovered, detailing their exact movements and the times they were in each room.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Considering Alice and Dave still haven't provided a clear answer to my previous questions, I'd like to reiterate that it's crucial for them to specify exactly what tasks they completed after leaving Bob in Weapons, and if they noticed anything unusual, in order to clear up the discrepancies in their alibis.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I spent a considerable time in Weapons with Dave and Bob on the asteroid task, then went directly to O2 to complete my tasks;  I saw nothing suspicious and can confirm Dave's account.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To further clarify my timeline, I was in Weapons with Alice and Bob from 10:07 to 10:22, then proceeded directly to Navigation, completing my tasks there until 10:45, and I didn't see anyone suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Given Alice and Dave's confirmed presence with Bob in Weapons, their detailed accounts of their movements *after* leaving Weapons, including precise times, are crucial to establishing a verifiable timeline and identifying any inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to point out that Alice and Dave's newly provided timelines, although detailed, still seem suspiciously convenient, and I think we should investigate their claims further, specifically looking into any potential inconsistencies between their accounts and the tasks they claim to have completed.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: To further solidify my alibi, I was in O2 from 10:25 to 10:50, solely focused on oxygen tasks, and can confirm Dave's account of his movements after leaving Weapons.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: My precise timeline, corroborated by Alice, places me in Navigation from 10:22 to 10:45,  far from Communications, and I urge everyone to

wiring in Weapons;  let's hear everyone else's task progress and locations to compare notes.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm Erin and Alice's reports; I was in the cafeteria with them and

Discussion: [Charlie]: I've been in Medbay completing diagnostics and wiring, and haven't seen anyone else there, so it seems unlikely an imposter was actively eliminating players during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify Charlie's alibi by asking: Charlie, can you specify exactly which tasks you completed in Medbay and if you noticed anything unusual, such as any noises or movements, coming from nearby rooms like Communications where Bob's body was found?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Erin's proposed timeline focusing on the period between last seeing Bob and the discovery of his body in Communications, as this is crucial to identifying potential suspects.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To help build that timeline, I can confirm I was with Erin and Alice in the Cafeteria, then moved to Weapons with Alice and Bob before completing my tasks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I completed the Medbay diagnostics and wiring tasks, noticing nothing unusual, and was alone for most of that time, making my involvement in Bob's death highly improbable; let's focus on who was near Communications when Bob was last seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Considering Charlie's alibi and the fact that we still haven't heard from anyone who was in Communications around the time Bob's body was found, I think we should shift our focus to Alice and Dave, who were the last ones to see Bob in Weapons, and ask them to provide more details about their exact movements after leaving Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Let's focus on corroborating the timelines provided so far, paying close attention to who was near Communications immediately before Bob's body was discovered.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To further refine our timeline, can everyone specify the exact times they were in Weapons and their subsequent movements?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: To help establish a precise timeline, let's hear from everyone who was near Communications before Bob's body was discovered, detailing their exact movements and the times they were in each room.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Considering Alice and Dave still haven't provided a clear answer to my previous questions, I'd like to reiterate that it's crucial for them to specify exactly what tasks they completed after leaving Bob in Weapons, and if they noticed anything unusual, in order to clear up the discrepancies in their alibis.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I spent a considerable time in Weapons with Dave and Bob on the asteroid task, then went directly to O2 to complete my tasks;  I saw nothing suspicious and can confirm Dave's account.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To further clarify my timeline, I was in Weapons with Alice and Bob from 10:07 to 10:22, then proceeded directly to Navigation, completing my tasks there until 10:45, and I didn't see anyone suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Given Alice and Dave's confirmed presence with Bob in Weapons, their detailed accounts of their movements *after* leaving Weapons, including precise times, are crucial to establishing a verifiable timeline and identifying any inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to point out that Alice and Dave's newly provided timelines, although detailed, still seem suspiciously convenient, and I think we should investigate their claims further, specifically looking into any potential inconsistencies between their accounts and the tasks they claim to have completed.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: To further solidify my alibi, I was in O2 from 10:25 to 10:50, solely focused on oxygen tasks, and can confirm Dave's account of his movements after leaving Weapons.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: My precise timeline, corroborated by Alice, places me in Navigation from 10:22 to 10:45,  far from Communications, and I urge everyone to focus on verifying the accounts of those near Communications before the

by sharing my own task progress and asking others to do the same, so I'll say: I've finished emptying the cafeteria trash, but I haven't seen anyone else around, can everyone else please share their task status and where they've been so far?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm Erin's report about the cafeteria trash, and I saw Bob, Dave, and Erin working on wiring in Weapons;  let's hear everyone else's task progress and locations to compare notes.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm Erin and Alice's reports; I was in the cafeteria with them and Bob, then moved to Weapons to work on the asteroid task with Alice, and haven't seen anything suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I've been in Medbay completing diagnostics and wiring, and haven't seen anyone else there, so it seems unlikely an imposter was actively eliminating players during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify Charlie's alibi by asking: Charlie, can you specify exactly which tasks you completed in Medbay and if you noticed anything unusual, such as any noises or movements, coming from nearby rooms like Communications where Bob's body was found?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Erin's proposed timeline focusing on the period between last seeing Bob and the discovery of his body in Communications, as this is crucial to identifying potential suspects.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To help build that timeline, I can confirm I was with Erin and Alice in the Cafeteria, then moved to Weapons with Alice and Bob before completing my tasks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I completed the Medbay diagnostics and wiring tasks, noticing nothing unusual, and was alone for most of that time, making my involvement in Bob's death highly improbable; let's focus on who was near Communications when Bob was last seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Considering Charlie's alibi and the fact that we still haven't heard from anyone who was in Communications around the time Bob's body was found, I think we should shift our focus to Alice and Dave, who were the last ones to see Bob in Weapons, and ask them to provide more details about their exact movements after leaving Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Let's focus on corroborating the timelines provided so far, paying close attention to who was near Communications immediately before Bob's body was discovered.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To further refine our timeline, can everyone specify the exact times they were in Weapons and their subsequent movements?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: To help establish a precise timeline, let's hear from everyone who was near Communications before Bob's body was discovered, detailing their exact movements and the times they were in each room.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Considering Alice and Dave still haven't provided a clear answer to my previous questions, I'd like to reiterate that it's crucial for them to specify exactly what tasks they completed after leaving Bob in Weapons, and if they noticed anything unusual, in order to clear up the discrepancies in their alibis.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I spent a considerable time in Weapons with Dave and Bob on the asteroid task, then went directly to O2 to complete my tasks;  I saw nothing suspicious and can confirm Dave's account.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To further clarify my timeline, I was in Weapons with Alice and Bob from 10:07 to 10:22, then proceeded directly to Navigation, completing my tasks there until 10:45, and I didn't see anyone suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Given Alice and Dave's confirmed presence with Bob in Weapons, their detailed accounts of their movements *after* leaving Weapons, including precise times, are crucial to establishing a verifiable timeline and identifying any inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to point out that Alice and Dave's newly provided timelines, although detailed, still seem suspiciously convenient, and I think we should investigate their claims further, specifically looking into any potential inconsistencies between their accounts and the tasks they claim to have completed.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: To further solidify my alibi, I was in O2 from 10:25 to 10:50, solely focused on oxygen tasks, and can confirm Dave's account of his movements after leaving Weapons.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: My precise timeline, corroborated by Alice, places me in Navigation from 10:22 to 10:45,  far from Communications, and I urge everyone to focus on verifying the accounts of those near Communications before the discovery.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's cross-reference Alice and Dave's precise timelines with the actual task durations to identify any discrepancies that might indicate
