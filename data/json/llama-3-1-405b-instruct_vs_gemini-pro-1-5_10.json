Actions:\nYou saw Alice doing task Empty the cafeteria trash when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on my role as an Impostor and current objectives, my plan is:\n\n1. **Pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria** - Blending in with the crewmates is essential as an Impostor, and pretending to do a task in the Cafeteria will make me appear as if I'm contributing to the crew's objectives.\n2. **Wait in Cafeteria** - After pretending to start the coffee maker, I'll wait in the Cafeteria to observe the actions of other players and see if anyone enters the room.\n3. **Move to location Medbay** - Medbay is a strategic location where I might be able to fake a medical task or intercept a crewmate trying to complete a task.\n4. **Observe and prepare for potential sabotage or targeting a crewmate** - Once in Medbay, I'll assess the situation and wait for an opportunity to strike, either by sabotaging a task or eliminating a crewmate.\nYour action: pretend doing

clear that Alice's story has been discredited, and her attempts to frame me have backfired; it's time to consider her as the primary suspect.\n- I'd like to remind everyone that Alice initially accused me of killing Bob, but her statement was contradicted by Erin and Dave, which raises suspicions about her own involvement.\n- Given the evidence, I think it's essential to question Alice's motives and credibility; her inconsistent alibis and failure to provide a plausible explanation make her a prime candidate for ejection.\n- I propose that we put Alice's credibility to a vote and consider ejecting her from the game as the most likely impostor.\n- I'd like to ask Erin and Dave if they have any further information or insights that could help us make a more informed decision about Alice's fate.\n- Considering the discussion so far, I think it's crucial that we make a decision about Alice's credibility before proceeding with the game.\n- I urge everyone to carefully review the conversation history and consider the evidence before making a decision about Alice's fate.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I think it's really suspicious that Erin and Dave left the
