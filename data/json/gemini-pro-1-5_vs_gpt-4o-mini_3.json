useful information or witness any suspicious behavior.\n3. **Prepare to Discuss** - When the Discussion Phase begins, share any insights you may have collected from your observation and prepare to

[Bob]: I just finished the trash task in the cafeteria, and I saw both Charlie and Dave doing tasks there too, which seems like a good sign for them, but let\u2019s make sure to keep an eye on anyone who might follow Charlie to Medbay without being seen.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob about keeping an eye on those following Charlie to Medbay, and since I'm alone in Admin with no one entering or leaving recently, it might be a good time to check if anyone can vouch for Alice after she started the coffee maker.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm that I saw both Charlie and Bob doing tasks in the cafeteria, which gives them some credibility, and Erin, since you're in Admin alone, can you tell us if anyone entered or left while you were there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, you're right, you saw me *start* the trash, then I heard Alice scream and ran to the Cafeteria \u2013 that's when you saw me again, not still doing trash.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can confirm I saw Alice doing the coffee maker task right before the body was found, which means she was active before her death, but Charlie, could you clarify how long you were in the cafeteria before you heard the scream?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, it\u2019s crucial for us to establish how long you were in the cafeteria before hearing the scream, as this could help us pinpoint who was near Alice right before her death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, could you clarify your timeline a bit more, as it's important to establish how long you were in the cafeteria before the scream to help us identify who was near Alice before her death?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It feels like you're all fixated on my whereabouts; I was in the cafeteria briefly, then heard Alice scream and ran towards the sound, finding her body near the coffee maker.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, I appreciate your response, but could you specify how briefly you were in the cafeteria and if you noticed anyone else around before you heard the scream? This detail could really help us understand the timeline better.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your timeline is crucial, so could you please clarify how long you were in the cafeteria and if you noticed anyone else nearby before Alice screamed?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, it seems like everyone is trying to clarify your timeline, which is understandable given the circumstances; could you give us a more precise duration you spent in the cafeteria before hearing the scream, as this could really help us piece together what happened?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was only in the cafeteria for a minute, maybe two at most, just long enough to start the trash, and I only saw Bob and Dave before hearing Alice scream.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, since you were only in the cafeteria for a minute or two, it's concerning that you didn't notice anyone else around; can you think of anyone who might have been lurking nearby when Alice was killed?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, since you were in the cafeteria for such a brief time, it's concerning that you didn't see anyone else; can you clarify if you noticed anyone else near the coffee maker area when you heard Alice scream?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your timeline is indeed crucial, and if you were only in the cafeteria for a minute or two, it raises significant questions about who could have been around during that time; we need to dig deeper into your account and see if anyone can corroborate your story.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If I was only there for a minute or two, wouldn't it be *more* likely I *didn't* see the killer, rather than that I'm the killer myself?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, while it's possible you didn't see the killer, your quick exit from the cafeteria raises red flags, especially since Alice was found near the coffee maker; we need to investigate further who else was in that area during your brief stay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your insistence on such a brief time in the cafeteria is raising suspicions, and I think we should ask Bob or Dave if they noticed anyone else lurking nearby during that moment, as that could provide crucial insight into Alice's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I believe we should focus on establishing a clearer timeline for Charlie's actions in the cafeteria, as his quick exit raises valid concerns, and Bob, could you share if you noticed anyone else in the area during that time?\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Charlie]: I'm heading to Medbay now, anyone need to scan?\n[Bob]: I just finished the trash task in the cafeteria, and I saw both Charlie and Dave doing tasks there too, which seems like a good sign for them, but let\u2019s make sure to keep an eye on anyone who might follow Charlie to Medbay without being seen.\n[Erin]: I agree with Bob about keeping an eye on those following Charlie to Medbay, and since I'm alone in Admin with no one entering or leaving recently, it might be a good time to check if anyone can vouch for Alice after she started the coffee maker.\n[Dave]: I can confirm that I saw both Charlie and Bob doing tasks in the cafeteria, which gives them some credibility, and Erin, since you're in Admin alone, can you tell us if anyone entered or left while you were there?\n[Charlie]: Bob, you're right, you saw me *start* the trash, then I heard Alice scream and ran to the Cafeteria \u2013 that's when you saw me again, not still doing trash.\n[Bob]: I can confirm I saw Alice doing the coffee maker task right before the body was found, which means she was active before her death, but Charlie, could you clarify how long you were in the cafeteria before you heard the scream?\n[Erin]: Charlie, it\u2019s crucial for us to establish how long you were in the cafeteria before hearing the scream, as this could help us pinpoint who was near Alice right before her death.\n[Dave]: Charlie, could you clarify your timeline a bit more, as it's important to establish how long you were in the cafeteria before the scream to help us identify who was near Alice before her death?\n[Charlie]: It feels like you're all fixated on my whereabouts; I was in the cafeteria briefly, then heard Alice scream and ran towards the sound, finding her body near the coffee maker.\n[Bob]: Charlie, I appreciate your response, but could you specify how briefly you were in the cafeteria and if you noticed anyone else around before you heard the scream?
