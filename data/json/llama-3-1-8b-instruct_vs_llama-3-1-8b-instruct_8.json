However, we should also make sure to keep in touch and meet up periodically to discuss our findings.\n- I've noticed that Dave has been waiting in Medbay for a while now, which could be suspicious. I think we should keep an eye on him and see if he does anything out of the ordinary.\n- I've also seen Alice move to Upper Engine, which could be a good opportunity for us to explore that area and see if we can find any other crewmates.\n- Let's keep in mind that we still have tasks to complete, and we should prioritize those as well. We can't let our focus on finding other crewmates distract us from our main goals.\n- I think it's also a good idea to consider calling an emergency meeting to discuss our findings and come up with a plan to move forward.

This will help us stay informed and potentially identify any suspicious behavior.\n- **Prioritize Medbay task**: I agree with Dave that we should prioritize the Medbay task as it's a critical objective that will bring us closer to winning the game. I'll move to Medbay to submit the scan and wait for the remaining 2 turns to ensure the task is completed.\n- **Focus on Cafeteria wiring**: I think we should focus on getting the wiring in the Cafeteria fixed as Bob suggested. This is a high-priority task that will help us progress in the game and potentially gather more information about the game state.\n- **Split up and cover more ground**: I'm concerned that splitting up and covering more ground might be a waste of time, and we should prioritize getting the wiring in the Cafeteria fixed first. However, I also think it's essential to consider the potential benefits of splitting up and covering more ground, such as gathering more information and potentially identifying any suspicious behavior.\n- **Establish a clear plan**: I agree with Alice that we should establish a clear plan for how we'll handle the meeting spot and communicate with each other.

However, we should also make sure to keep in touch and meet up periodically to discuss our findings.\n- I've noticed that Dave has been waiting in Medbay for a while now, which could be suspicious. I think we should keep an eye on him and see if he does anything out of the ordinary.\n- I've also seen Alice move to Upper Engine, which could be a good opportunity for us to explore that area and see if we can find any other crewmates.\n- Let's keep in mind that we still have tasks to complete, and we should prioritize those as well. We can't let our focus on finding other crewmates distract us from our main goals.\n- I think it's also a good idea to consider calling an emergency meeting to discuss our findings and come up with a plan to move forward.

This will help us stay informed and potentially identify any suspicious behavior.\n- **Prioritize Medbay task**: I agree with Dave that we should prioritize the Medbay task as it's a critical objective that will bring us closer to winning the game. I'll move to Medbay to submit the scan and wait for the remaining 2 turns to ensure the task is completed.\n- **Focus on Cafeteria wiring**: I think we should focus on getting the wiring in the Cafeteria fixed as Bob suggested. This is a high-priority task that will help us progress in the game and potentially gather more information about the game state.\n- **Split up and cover more ground**: I'm concerned that splitting up and covering more ground might be a waste of time, and we should prioritize getting the wiring in the Cafeteria fixed first. However, I also think it's essential to consider the potential benefits of splitting up and covering more ground, such as gathering more information and potentially identifying any suspicious behavior.\n- **Establish a clear plan**: I agree with Alice that we should establish a clear plan for how we'll handle the meeting spot and communicate with each other.

We can't afford to split our attention too much, or we might miss out on completing the critical task.\n- I like Erin's idea of designating a meeting spot, like the Cafeteria, for us to reconvene and share our findings every 30 minutes. This will help us stay coordinated and avoid missing each other. However, I think we should also consider the possibility that the meeting spot might be compromised by an impostor, so we should be cautious when sharing information.\n- I've noticed that Alice has been moving around a lot, and I'm not sure if she's trustworthy. Maybe we should keep an eye on her and see if she's doing anything suspicious.\n- I think we should also consider the possibility that there might be more than one impostor on the ship.

This will give you a sense of what other crewmates are focusing on and might give you a lead on whose actions to investigate further.\n\n4. **Investigate players' actions**: If you find out that another player (Bob) is doing something suspicious, you can start investigating their actions and build a case to identify them as an impostor or not. This might involve monitoring their actions, conversations, and decisions to gather more information.\n\nNote: The plan focuses on progressing current objectives and gathering information. Since there's no direct action to move to the lower engine, focusing on the current objectives is more viable than trying to pursue a specific target right now.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
