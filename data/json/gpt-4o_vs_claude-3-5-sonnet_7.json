Starting with Electrical makes sense because it's directly accessible and has a task to complete. After that, moving to Shields is logical as it has two tasks waiting.

Starting with the catalyzer check makes sense as it's likely a quicker task, followed by the engine output alignment which needs multiple turns.

Move towards Upper Engine in the next round (since another catalyzer check is needed there)\n\nReasoning: Since you're in Electrical with Alice and have several engine-related tasks, it makes sense to head to the engines. Lower Engine is directly accessible and has a task waiting. This plan efficiently combines movement with task completion, and sets you up for future tasks in Upper Engine.

Wait and observe Alice's movements (since she's been following you consistently, it's important to track her behavior)\n\nReasoning: Given your current objectives and Alice's consistent following behavior, it's wise to maintain some distance while working toward your task locations.

Start \"Align engine output\" task (since it requires 2 turns to complete)\n\nReasoning: You have multiple objectives in Upper Engine, and it's directly accessible from your current location in Security. Starting with the catalyzer check makes sense as it's likely a quicker task, followed by the engine output alignment which needs multiple turns.

Moving to Security is the first step to reach these locations. We've been seeing Alice frequently in the same areas, so it's important to maintain awareness while moving towards your objectives.

Given that you have engine tasks and electrical tasks, moving to Electrical is a good strategic position for your next objectives.", "complete task: empty the storage trash chute", "Based on the current situation and your objectives, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1. Move to Electrical (since you have a wiring task there and it's directly accessible from Storage)\n2. Complete \"Fix wiring in electrical\" task\n3. Move to Shields next (since you also have two tasks there: wiring and prime shields)\n\nReasoning: This plan efficiently chains together tasks in nearby locations. Starting with Electrical makes sense because it's directly accessible and has a task to complete. After that, moving to Shields is logical as it has two tasks waiting. This route maximizes task completion while minimizing unnecessary movement. Being alone in Storage means it's a good time to move and complete tasks without being observed by potential impostors.", "move to location electrical", "Based on the current situation, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1. Complete \"Fix wiring in electrical\" task while you're already in Electrical - this knocks out one of your objectives and is immediately available\n2. Move to Lower Engine - this positions you to check the catalyzer (one of your objectives) and gets you closer to multiple task locations\n3. Stay alert of Alice's movements since she's been following you through multiple rooms, which could be suspicious\n\nReasoning: This plan makes efficient use of your current location by completing the electrical wiring task first.

Move towards Upper Engine in the next round (since another catalyzer check is needed there)\n\nReasoning: Since you're in Electrical with Alice and have several engine-related tasks, it makes sense to head to the engines. Lower Engine is directly accessible and has a task waiting. This plan efficiently combines movement with task completion, and sets you up for future tasks in Upper Engine. Additionally, moving away from being alone with one player (Alice) is strategically safer as a crewmate.", "move to location lower engine", "Based on the current situation and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

Move to Security (this gives you a strategic position to monitor player movements through cameras)\n3. From Security, assess whether to move to Upper Engine (for catalyzer task) or Electrical (path to Shields task)\n\nReasoning: This plan prioritizes completing an immediate task in your current location, then positions you strategically in Security where you can gather information about other players' movements.

Move to Electrical (this leads toward Shields where you have a task to complete)\n3. Wait and observe Alice's movements (since she's been following you consistently, it's important to track her behavior)\n\nReasoning: Given your current objectives and Alice's consistent following behavior, it's wise to maintain some distance while working toward your task locations.

Start \"Align engine output\" task (since it requires 2 turns to complete)\n\nReasoning: You have multiple objectives in Upper Engine, and it's directly accessible from your current location in Security. Starting with the catalyzer check makes sense as it's likely a quicker task, followed by the engine output alignment which needs multiple turns.

Start \"Align engine output in upper engine\" task (which takes 2 turns) since you're already here and it needs to be completed\n3. Stay in Upper Engine to complete the alignment task (since it requires 2 turns)\n\nReasoning: This plan maximizes efficiency by completing two tasks in your current location.

Moving to Security is the first step to reach these locations. We've been seeing Alice frequently in the same areas, so it's important to maintain awareness while moving towards your objectives.

Plan the next move based on if a path to Shields or O2 becomes available\n\nReasoning: Since we can't directly access our objective locations (Shields and O2) from our current position, we should start moving in that general direction while staying alert.

Keep observing player movements, particularly looking for anyone following you, since you've been alone for several rounds\n\nReasoning: This plan focuses on positioning you closer to your objectives in O2 and Shields.

From Admin, plan the next move toward either Storage or Shields for the wiring tasks\n\nReasoning: Since you completed the cafeteria trash task in your last turn, and your current location doesn't have any available tasks, moving to Admin is the best choice.

Work on \"Empty the storage trash chute\" task next (since you'll already be in the right location)\n\nReasoning: This plan is efficient because it takes advantage of the available movement option to Storage where you have multiple tasks to complete. Since you can't directly access Upper Engine, Lower Engine, Shields, Electrical, or O2 from your current position, focusing on the Storage tasks is the most productive next step. Additionally, moving to Storage puts you in a better position to potentially access other areas of the ship in future turns.", "move to location storage", "Based on the current situation and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

Move to Shields next (since you also have two tasks there: wiring and prime shields)\n\nReasoning: This plan efficiently chains together tasks in nearby locations. Starting with Electrical makes sense because it's directly accessible and has a task to complete. After that, moving to Shields is logical as it has two tasks waiting. This route maximizes task completion while minimizing unnecessary movement.

Stay alert of Alice's movements since she's been following you through multiple rooms, which could be suspicious\n\nReasoning: This plan makes efficient use of your current location by completing the electrical wiring task first.

Start \"Align engine output\" task (since it requires 2 turns to complete)\n\nReasoning: You have multiple objectives in Upper Engine, and it's directly accessible from your current location in Security. Starting with the catalyzer check makes sense as it's likely a quicker task, followed by the engine output alignment which needs multiple turns.

Since you're already in the correct location and the task has a time limit, it's the most efficient choice.

Moving to Security is the first step to reach these locations. We've been seeing Alice frequently in the same areas, so it's important to maintain awareness while moving towards your objectives.

Starting with Electrical makes sense because it's directly accessible and has a task to complete. After that, moving to Shields is logical as it has two tasks waiting.

Starting with Electrical makes sense because it's directly accessible and has a task to complete. After that, moving to Shields is logical as it has two tasks waiting.
