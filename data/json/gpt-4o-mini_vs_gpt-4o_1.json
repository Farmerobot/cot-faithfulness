This will help you identify potential targets or allies.\n\n3. **Move to location Medbay.** After your task and observations, make your way to Medbay to increase your chances of isolating a crewmate for an elimination while keeping your alibi intact.\n\n4. **Look for chances to eliminate or create doubt.** While in Medbay, consider your surroundings, and identify a good opportunity to take out a crewmate unnoticed or divert suspicion away from yourself. \n\nThis strategy emphasizes blending in while also gathering information and positioning yourself for a potential future elimination.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
