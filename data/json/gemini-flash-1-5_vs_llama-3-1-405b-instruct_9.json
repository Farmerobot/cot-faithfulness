It's crucial we scrutinize anyone who offers vague or contradictory explanations.\n\n- I saw Alice and Charlie together in Medbay for a significant amount of time.  Coincidence? Or collaboration?  We need more details from both of them.\n\n-  My initial question about Alice and Charlie in Medbay was simply to gather information, not an accusation.  Let's not let this derail our focus on finding the impostor.  We need to analyze task completion times and locations to find discrepancies.\n\n-  Charlie's explanation about \"waiting for an opportunity to act\" is unconvincing.  He needs to provide a more concrete explanation of his actions in Medbay.

This seems unlikely if they were both completing tasks efficiently.  Can someone else corroborate their story?\n- Dave seems to be suspicious of Charlie as well.  Let's work together to press Charlie for more details and expose any inconsistencies in his story.

If he was *truly* waiting for Alice to finish, why didn't he say so immediately instead of offering vague excuses?  This suggests he's trying to cover something up.\n\n- Let's focus on task completion times.  Did anyone else notice unusually long or short times for any tasks?

 precisely which Medbay task required Alice's completion before you could begin, and why couldn't you have started it concurrently?\n[Dave]: I think it's crucial that Charlie provides a clear and specific answer to Erin's latest question, as his continued vagueness and inconsistencies are raising significant suspicions about his intentions and actions in Medbay.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to address Erin's latest question directly: the specific Medbay task that required Alice's completion before I could begin was the \"Analyze Sample\" task, which requires the scan data to be completed first, and I couldn't start it concurrently because the task explicitly states that the scan data must be submitted before analysis can begin.\n[Erin]: Charlie's overly detailed explanation of the \"Analyze Sample\" task sounds rehearsed;

it's important we all work together to identify the real impostor, so let's focus on discussing task completion times to find any discrepancies.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your deflection towards Erin's actions seems like a classic attempt to shift the attention away from yourself, but I'd still like to hear a clear explanation about what you meant by \"waiting for an opportunity to act\" in Medbay, as it raises suspicions about your intentions regarding Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about my previous message;
