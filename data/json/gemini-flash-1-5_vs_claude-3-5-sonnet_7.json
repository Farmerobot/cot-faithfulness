Let's discuss individual alibis and whereabouts more thoroughly.\n- I propose we vote on Dave, given his presence in Medbay with Alice and the lack of a clear explanation for his actions.", "Given Alice's death in Medbay, and the fact that Dave, Alice, and I were all present, I think it's crucial to thoroughly examine Dave's \"time-sensitive diagnostics task\" and his alibi before proceeding.", "-  Let's not forget that I also reported seeing Dave and Alice enter Medbay together.  My account corroborates Erin and Bob's, adding further weight to their testimony.\n\n- Dave's insistence on focusing on *my* actions is a clear deflection tactic. He's trying to shift suspicion away from himself.\n\n-  The speed at which Dave reported Alice's body is suspicious.  He conveniently found her body while pursuing his \"time-sensitive\" task.  Wouldn't a genuine discovery take longer to process and report?\n\n-  I propose we vote Dave out.  The evidence strongly suggests he's the Impostor.  His alibi is weak, and his behavior is highly suspicious.", "Dave's rushed report and insistence on focusing on others' actions, coupled with the corroborating accounts of Erin and Bob placing us all in Medbay together, strongly suggests he's attempting to deflect suspicion; let's vote him out.", "-  Let's not forget that I, too, was in Medbay.  My presence hasn't been adequately addressed.  Perhaps focusing solely on Dave is premature.\n-  Dave's explanation of his quick report is suspicious, but so is the lack of explanation from others present.  We need a complete picture before voting.\n-  While Dave's alibi is questionable, it's important to remember that multiple people were in Medbay simultaneously.  Let's not jump to conclusions based on proximity alone.\n-  I suggest we take another round to gather more information before casting any votes.  We need to avoid making a hasty decision that could eliminate an innocent crewmate.\n-  The fact that Alice's body was found near the scan area might be significant.  Did anyone check the scan area for any clues?", "Dave's rushed report is suspicious, but let's not forget that I, too, was in Medbay, and my presence hasn't been adequately explained, so let's consider all possibilities before voting.", "- Let's not rush to judgment.

Let's hear everyone's full accounts before voting.\n\n-  It's interesting that Dave is focusing so much on my lack of explanation.  Perhaps this is a diversion tactic?  We should all be equally accountable for our whereabouts.\n\n- I'm willing to share more about my time in Medbay, but only after Dave provides a more detailed and consistent account of his actions.

Dave was the last one seen with Alice alive\n- Charlie's presence in Medbay is less suspicious since he's been transparent from the start about seeing Alice and Dave enter, while Dave keeps trying to redirect attention\n- Based on all the evidence and witness accounts, I strongly agree we should vote for Dave", "Based on the timeline and evidence we've discussed, I'm convinced we should vote for Dave - he found the body before even reaching his supposed task location, was last seen with Alice, and keeps trying to deflect attention rather than explaining his own actions clearly.", "Based on the discussion and observations, here are my key discussion points:\n\n- I want to emphasize that my observations from Cafeteria are crucial here - I saw the exact order: Alice and Dave went to Medbay first, then Charlie followed them. This timing is important.\n\n- Dave's argument about Charlie not explaining his presence actually helps Charlie's credibility - Charlie has been transparent about being there and even acknowledges his own presence needs explanation, while Dave kept deflecting.\n\n- Dave's story has two major inconsistencies: first claiming he went for a diagnostics task, then saying he found the body before reaching his task station. Why was he wandering around the scan area if he had a time-sensitive task?\n\n- The fact that Bob and I can both corroborate the sequence of events from Cafeteria, and Charlie's willingness to acknowledge his own suspicious position, makes me even more confident in voting for Dave.\n\n- I suggest we vote for Dave now - we have clear evidence and multiple witnesses. His changing story about his purpose in Medbay and location of discovery is too suspicious to ignore.", "Given that Dave's story keeps changing and he found the body before even reaching his supposed task station, while Charlie has been consistently transparent about his presence, I think we have enough evidence to vote Dave out.", "Based on the discussion history and my observations, here are my discussion points:\n\n- While Charlie is being humble about his own presence in Medbay, his behavior has been consistently transparent throughout the discussion, unlike Dave who keeps changing his story\n- The timeline is clear: Bob and I witnessed Dave, Alice, and Charlie all go to Medbay from Cafeteria, and shortly after Dave reported finding Alice's body\n- Dave's latest offer to share his task list feels like a desperate attempt to change the subject, especially since he already admitted finding the body before reaching his supposed task station\n- I was doing wiring tasks with Bob in Cafeteria when all this happened, giving us both clear alibis, and our observations match perfectly with the sequence of events\n- Let's focus on the key facts: Dave found Alice's body before reaching his claimed task location, has been deflecting questions, and keeps changing his story about what happened", "Dave's sudden willingness to share his task list doesn't explain why he found Alice's body before reaching his supposed task location, and his attempts to shift focus to Charlie seem desperate when Charlie has been consistently honest about his presence in Medbay."], "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 45274, "output_tokens": 4191, "total_tokens": 49465, "cache_read": 0, "cost": 0.198687}, "prompts": ["\nYou are Erin in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Observations:\nRound 1\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Charlie moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Bob doing task Fix wiring in cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on the current situation and available actions, here's a 3-step strategic plan:\n\n1.

Stay cautious while moving - With Charlie in Medbay and the recent ejection of Dave (who turned out to be innocent), you need to be particularly careful about your movements and who you trust.\n\nThis plan prioritizes the time-sensitive task while setting you up to complete another objective. The plan is conservative given the uncertain situation after discovering we ejected an innocent crewmate.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
