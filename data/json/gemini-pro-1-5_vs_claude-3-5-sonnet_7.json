I'm starting to think you three are working together.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: Bob and I were together in Electrical, so he couldn't have been in Medbay.\n[Charlie]: I literally watched you kill Bob in Medbay while he was doing the scan task, Dave - you're lying about being in Electrical with him and Erin was there too and saw him scanning.\n[Erin]: I can absolutely confirm that I saw Dave kill Bob in Medbay while he was doing the scan task, and Dave is lying about being in Electrical with him.\n[Alice]: I can confirm that Dave is lying because I personally saw Bob, Charlie, and Erin go from Cafeteria to Medbay, plus I witnessed Dave doing trash in Cafeteria during that same time, so he definitely wasn't in Electrical like he claims.\n[Dave]: So, all three of you conveniently saw me kill Bob, but none of you thought to call a meeting until *after* I reported the body?\n[Charlie]: I understand your skepticism Dave, but the reason for the delayed report doesn't change the fact that three of us witnessed you murder Bob in Medbay while he was scanning, and your story about being in Electrical completely contradicts Alice seeing you in Cafeteria at that time.\n[Erin]: The evidence is overwhelming - we have three witnesses who can place Dave in different locations that contradict his Electrical story, and both Charlie and I directly saw him kill Bob during the scan in Medbay.\n[Alice]: Given that I saw Dave doing trash in Cafeteria at the exact time he claims to have been in Electrical with Bob, and we have two direct witnesses to the murder in Medbay, I think we have more than enough evidence to vote Dave out.\n[Dave]: This is clearly a coordinated effort to frame me; how is it possible three people happened to be in Medbay at the same time I was?\n[Charlie]: Dave, your story has changed multiple times - first claiming to be in Electrical, then Cafeteria for trash, and now questioning our presence in Medbay, but the simple truth is we all moved there from Cafeteria in sequence to watch Bob's scan.\n[Erin]: The sequence of events is crystal clear - we all moved from Cafeteria to Medbay in a logical order, which Alice witnessed, and your changing stories about being in Electrical versus Cafeteria only further prove your guilt, Dave.\n[Alice]: Dave's constantly shifting story about his location - from Electrical to Cafeteria to questioning our presence in Medbay - combined with two direct witnesses to Bob's murder and my own observation of him in Cafeteria, makes it absolutely clear that he's the impostor.\n[Dave]: Isn't it strange that none of you reported the body immediately if you *actually* saw me kill Bob?\n[Charlie]: The timing of the body report is irrelevant compared to the fact that we have multiple witnesses who saw you kill Bob in Medbay, and your story has changed from being in Electrical to being in Cafeteria, which completely undermines your credibility.\n[Erin]: The timing of the body report is a minor detail compared to the fact that we have three credible witnesses - Alice who saw you in Cafeteria contradicting your Electrical story, and both Charlie and myself who directly witnessed you kill Bob during his scan in Medbay.\n[Alice]: Dave's desperate focus on the body report timing while completely ignoring the multiple witnesses and his own contradictory stories about being in Electrical versus Cafeteria only further confirms his guilt as the impostor.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "So, three of you just *happened* to be in Medbay at the same time, witnessing my \"crime,\" while Alice conveniently saw me elsewhere \u2013 seems awfully orchestrated, don't you think?", "action_result": "", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "", "observations": [], "chat_messages": ["Discussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob and I were together in Electrical, so he couldn't have been in Medbay.", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I literally watched you kill Bob in Medbay while he was doing the scan task, Dave - you're lying about being in Electrical with him and Erin was there too and saw him scanning.", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can absolutely confirm that I saw Dave kill Bob in Medbay while he was doing the scan task, and Dave is lying about being in Electrical with him.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm that Dave is lying because I personally saw Bob, Charlie, and Erin go from Cafeteria to Medbay, plus I witnessed Dave doing trash in Cafeteria during that same time, so he definitely wasn't in Electrical like he claims.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: So, all three of you conveniently saw me kill Bob, but none of you thought to call a meeting until *after* I reported the body?", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand your skepticism Dave, but the reason for the delayed report doesn't change the fact that three of us witnessed you murder Bob in Medbay while he was scanning, and your story about being in Electrical completely contradicts Alice seeing you in Cafeteria at that time.", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: The evidence is overwhelming - we have three witnesses who can place Dave in different locations that contradict his Electrical story, and both Charlie and I directly saw him kill Bob during the scan in Medbay.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that I saw Dave doing trash in Cafeteria at the exact time he claims to have been in Electrical with Bob, and we have two direct witnesses to the murder in Medbay, I think we have more than enough evidence to vote Dave out.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: This is clearly a coordinated effort to frame me;

text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nGame History:\nRound 1\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Dave doing task Empty the cafeteria trash when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Bob moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Erin moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location in Cafeteria and the available actions, I'll create a plan that helps progress your objectives efficiently.\n\nLooking at your objectives and available moves, I notice you have two time-sensitive tasks (\"Prime shields\" and \"Run diagnostics in medbay\") with only 2 turns left. Additionally, you have a task in Weapons to calibrate the targeting system that you can access now.\n\nHere's the recommended 3-step plan:\n\n1. Move to Medbay to work on the time-sensitive diagnostics task\n2. Wait one turn while the diagnostics run (if required by the task)\n3. Move to Weapons to begin the calibration task\n\nThis plan prioritizes the time-sensitive task in Medbay while also positioning you to complete another objective. I'm recommending Medbay over Weapons first because of the time limit on the diagnostics task. After completing these steps, you'll be better positioned to handle other tasks in future turns.\nYour action: move to location medbay\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Bob, Erin]\nRound 2\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYou saw Bob doing task Submit scan in medbay when you were in Medbay\nYou saw Erin doing task Run diagnostics in medbay when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location in Cafeteria and the available actions, I'll create a plan that helps progress your objectives efficiently.\n\nLooking at your objectives and available moves, I notice you have two time-sensitive tasks (\"Prime shields\" and \"Run diagnostics in medbay\") with only 2 turns left.
