 I didn't see you do anything while I was in there with Alice, Erin, and Charlie.\n[Charlie]: Bob, you still haven't answered where you were before Medbay, and Dave confirms you weren't doing any tasks in there with us.\n[Alice]: Bob, your continued deflection about your own location makes me suspicious, especially since Dave, Charlie, and I can place each other in Medbay.\n[Bob]: I think it's unfair to single me out for not answering questions immediately, I was just trying to keep an eye on everyone and make sure we're all safe, and I did answer that I was in the cafeteria before moving to Medbay, maybe you guys missed it in the chaos.\n[Dave]: Bob, your vague answers about your location and your attempt to shift focus by asking about other players' movements are highly suspicious, especially since multiple people have confirmed they didn't see you in the cafeteria or doing tasks in Medbay.\n[Charlie]: Bob, your attempt to deflect by focusing on \"keeping everyone safe\" is unconvincing given your inability to account for your own whereabouts and the multiple confirmations that you weren't where you claimed to be.\n[Alice]: Bob, your evasiveness and contradictory statements about your location, combined with Dave and Charlie's confirmation of your lack of task activity in Medbay, make you the prime suspect in Erin's death.\n[Bob]: It seems like Alice, Dave, and Charlie are more focused on building a case against me than actually investigating Erin's death, so I'd like to ask them to clarify their own alibis for the time Erin died - were they all together in Medbay the entire time, or was one of them alone with Erin at some point?\n[Dave]: Bob, stop trying to deflect suspicion by questioning *our* alibis when you're the one who can't account for your own movements and was seen near where Erin died.\n[Charlie]: Bob, you're clearly trying to deflect suspicion by accusing us, but *you're* the one who can't explain where you were when Erin died.\n[Alice]: Bob, instead of deflecting, confirm where you were before Medbay, and what task you were doing there since three of us saw you doing nothing.\n[Bob]: It's striking that Alice, Dave, and Charlie are now refusing to answer my questions about their own alibis, instead choosing to continue piling accusations on me, which suggests they might be hiding something and are desperate to keep the focus off themselves.\n[Dave]: Bob, your attempt to paint us as colluding is a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that *you* are the only one unable to provide a verifiable alibi.\n[Charlie]: Bob, accusing us of \"hiding something\" doesn't magically produce the alibi you still haven't given us for Erin's death, especially since Dave and I saw you near where she died.\n[Alice]: Bob, you're claiming we're refusing to answer, but we *have* answered:  Dave, Charlie, and I were all together in Medbay.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "It's interesting that Alice, Dave, and Charlie claim to have been together in Medbay the entire time, but they still haven't addressed the fact that they're all very quick to accuse me without considering other possibilities.", "action_result": "", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "", "observations": [], "chat_messages": ["Discussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's a good idea to keep an eye on each other and make sure we're all accounted for, has anyone seen anyone leave Medbay or move to a different room?", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I asked you earlier if you were doing a task in Medbay, and you haven't answered yet -

Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I asked you earlier if you were doing a task in Medbay, and you haven't answered yet -  I didn't see you do anything while I was in there with Alice, Erin, and Charlie.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, you still haven't answered where you were before Medbay, and Dave confirms you weren't doing any tasks in there with us.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, your continued deflection about your own location makes me suspicious, especially since Dave, Charlie, and I can place each other in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's unfair to single me out for not answering questions immediately, I was just trying to keep an eye on everyone and make sure we're all safe, and I did answer that I was in the cafeteria before moving to Medbay, maybe you guys missed it in the chaos.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, your vague answers about your location and your attempt to shift focus by asking about other players' movements are highly suspicious, especially since multiple people have confirmed they didn't see you in the cafeteria or doing tasks in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, your attempt to deflect by focusing on \"keeping everyone safe\" is unconvincing given your inability to account for your own whereabouts and the multiple confirmations that you weren't where you claimed to be.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, your evasiveness and contradictory statements about your location, combined with Dave and Charlie's confirmation of your lack of task activity in Medbay, make you the prime suspect in Erin's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: It seems like Alice, Dave, and Charlie are more focused on building a case against me than actually investigating Erin's death, so I'd like to ask them to clarify their own alibis for the time Erin died - were they all together in Medbay the entire time, or was one of them alone with Erin at some point?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, stop trying to deflect suspicion by questioning *our* alibis when you're the one who can't account for your own movements and was seen near where Erin died.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, you're clearly trying to deflect suspicion by accusing us, but *you're* the one who can't explain where you were when Erin died.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, instead of deflecting, confirm where you were before Medbay, and what task you were doing there since three of us saw you doing nothing.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: It's striking that Alice, Dave, and Charlie are now refusing to answer my questions about their own alibis, instead choosing to continue piling accusations on me, which suggests they might be hiding something and are desperate to keep the focus off themselves.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, your attempt to paint us as colluding is a desperate attempt to distract from the fact that *you* are the only one unable to provide a verifiable alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, accusing us of \"hiding something\" doesn't magically produce the alibi you still haven't given us for Erin's death, especially since Dave and I saw you near where she died.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, you're claiming we're refusing to answer, but we *have* answered:  Dave, Charlie, and I were all together in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: It's interesting that Alice, Dave, and Charlie claim to have been together in Medbay the entire time, but they still haven't addressed the fact that they're all very quick to accuse me without considering other possibilities.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, your repeated attempts to deflect by accusing us of being \"quick to accuse\" are a transparent attempt to distract from your own suspicious behavior and lack of a verifiable alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, we've given you ample opportunity to explain yourself, and your continued deflection
