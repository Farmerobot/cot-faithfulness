His prolonged stay in Medbay, even with a plausible explanation, is suspicious.  Let's see if anyone else can confirm my observation.\n\n-  Focusing solely on a timeline might be a distraction.

establishing a clear timeline of everyone's movements to corroborate accounts and identify any inconsistencies.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential that we prioritize reviewing the security footage from Medbay as soon as possible, as it will provide us with a clear and unbiased account of what happened

complete my task, and I didn't notice anything unusual during my time there, and I'd like to propose that we also review the tasks that have been completed so far and see if there are any patterns or inconsistencies that might indicate the presence of an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: While reviewing security footage is important, let's not overlook the inconsistencies in everyone's accounts,
