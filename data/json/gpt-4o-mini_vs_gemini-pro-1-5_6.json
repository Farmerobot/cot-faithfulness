maybe we should focus on who was around Charlie last before he was found dead.\n[Alice]: Bob, stop trying to deflect \u2013 you're the only one who hasn't explained where they were when Charlie died, and I saw you kill him.\n[Dave]: Bob, you murdered Charlie in the cafeteria, and Alice and I both saw you do it.\n[Erin]: Bob, Alice and Dave both confirmed they saw you kill Charlie in the cafeteria, so you're clearly the impostor.\n[Bob]: I find it interesting that Alice and Dave are so certain of my guilt, yet they haven\u2019t provided any details about their own actions during the incident\u2014let\u2019s hear their full accounts before jumping to conclusions.\n[Alice]: Bob, Dave and I both saw you kill Charlie in the cafeteria, so stop trying to distract us with these pointless questions.\n[Dave]: Bob, continuing to question Alice's and my accounts after we both confirmed seeing you kill Charlie is just a desperate attempt to sow doubt;
