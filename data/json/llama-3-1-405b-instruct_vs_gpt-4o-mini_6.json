room for both Round 1 and Round 2, trying to fix the wiring, and I didn't see anyone suspicious around me, but I did notice that Dave passed by the room in Round 2, heading towards Medbay again.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can confirm that I saw Charlie working on the wiring in the cafeteria during Round 1, so his alibi seems solid, but Dave, since you moved to Medbay from Cafeteria, can you share what you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob; we need to focus on Dave's suspicious movement to Medbay right after Erin's elimination\u2014what task were you planning to do there, Dave?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Medbay to complete my task, but I can see how my movement might look suspicious given the timing of Erin's elimination; however, I would like to hear if anyone can confirm Charlie's presence in Electrical, as that could help clarify things.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I appreciate Dave's attempt to deflect attention, but I'd like to reiterate that Bob has already confirmed my alibi for Round 1, and I'd still like to hear more about what specific task Dave was planning to do in Medbay, as his explanation seems vague.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, it\u2019s crucial for us to understand what specific task you were planning to complete in Medbay, especially since your timing raises concerns after Erin\u2019s elimination; your lack of detail could mean we need to reconsider your involvement.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, while you claim to have been in Electrical, I saw you eliminate Erin right in front of me, which makes you the prime suspect and we must vote you out to ensure our safety.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I understand that my movement to Medbay raises questions, but I can assure you that I was focused on completing my tasks; however, Alice's eyewitness account of Charlie eliminating Erin is compelling evidence, and I believe we should prioritize voting Charlie out to ensure our safety.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to address Alice's claim that she saw me eliminate Erin; I think this is a desperate attempt to frame me, and I'd like to remind everyone that Alice was also in the cafeteria with me and Erin during Round 1, yet she's only now coming forward with this accusation.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I find it troubling that Alice's accusation hinges solely on her word, especially since Charlie's alibi has been corroborated by me; we should consider the possibility of misdirection before making a hasty decision.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, your attempt to discredit my eyewitness account is a clear tactic to divert attention from your actions, and we cannot afford to ignore the direct evidence I provided; it's vital we vote you out for our safety.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I appreciate the urgency in Alice's claim, but we must remain cautious and analyze both her and Charlie's actions thoroughly before making a decision, as jumping to conclusions could lead us to eliminate the wrong player.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that Alice's accusation of me eliminating Erin is still unsubstantiated, and I believe she's trying to frame me to save herself, especially since she waited so long to come forward with her eyewitness account and didn't mention it earlier in the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's essential to scrutinize Alice's sudden accusation against Charlie, as it seems like a calculated move to shift the blame, especially considering the timing and her lack of evidence until now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, your attempts to undermine my eyewitness account only reinforce my belief that you are trying to deflect blame; I urge everyone to vote for you based on the clear evidence of your guilt in Erin's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I believe we should focus on the inconsistencies in both Alice's and Charlie's statements, as it seems that Alice's sudden accusation may be an attempt to shift blame away from herself, and we need to ensure we make a decision based on solid evidence rather than emotions.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to point out that Alice's accusation against me is still based solely on her word, and I find it suspicious that she waited until the discussion was already underway to share this information, which seems like a calculated move to divert attention from her own actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to remain cautious and analyze Alice's delayed accusation against Charlie, as it raises concerns about her credibility and could be an attempt to deflect blame away from herself.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, your continuous attempts to undermine my eyewitness account only highlight your desperation to shift the blame; we must prioritize the undeniable evidence of your actions and vote you out for the safety of all crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think we should take a
