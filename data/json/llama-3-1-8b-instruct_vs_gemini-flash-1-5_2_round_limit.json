Finding evidence related to Dave and Erin's deaths should be our top priority.\n- Charlie, your concerns about my alibi are unfounded.  Alice has already corroborated my presence in various locations, and I've consistently reported my actions.  Let's focus on solving the murders before making further accusations.\n-  We only have a few rounds left.  Let's avoid getting sidetracked by individual alibis until we've exhausted the Medbay investigation.  We need concrete evidence, not speculation.\n-  If we find nothing in Medbay, *then* we can revisit the task completion verification.  But right now, solving the murders is paramount.\n-  I propose we each systematically describe our movements and observations in Medbay during the time of the deaths. This will help us establish a clear timeline and identify any inconsistencies.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I think we should focus on verifying the authenticity of Bob's task completions, as his frequent presence in the Cafeteria could be a sign of his genuine effort to contribute to the game, and it would be beneficial to clear his name before proceeding with any further eliminations.\n[Bob]: Alice, can you confirm seeing me in the Cafeteria and other rooms where I've reported completing tasks, as Charlie suggested we verify my movements?\n[Alice]: I can confirm seeing Bob in the Cafeteria, Admin, Storage, and Electrical;
