contains two tasks you need to complete: fixing the wiring and calibrating the targeting system.\n\n3. **Fix Wiring in Weapons** - Upon arrival in Weapons, start by fixing the wiring to continue completing your tasks efficiently.\n\n4. **Calibrate Targeting System in Weapons** - If time allows and conditions are safe, proceed to calibrate the targeting system to further assist the crewmates
