like to add that Erin's insistence on having a solid alibi and asking us to vouch for her presence in Medbay seems suspicious, and I think we should continue to scrutinize her claims, especially

directly: Erin, can you explain why you're asking us to vouch for your presence in Medbay if you're confident about what happened?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's crucial that we continue

eliminated Alice, and see if anyone else has any information about her actions or interactions with Alice before the elimination.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been thinking about the sequence of events in Medbay, and I remember seeing Erin talking to Alex in Medbay around the time Alice was eliminated, which could suggest that Erin was coordinating with someone, and I think we should discuss

also investigate Erin's claim about seeing Bob vent in Electrical, but I think we should prioritize looking into Erin's suspicious behavior in Medbay, where she eliminated Alice, and see if anyone

about the sequence of events in Medbay, and I remember seeing Erin talking to Alex in Medbay around the time Alice was eliminated, which could suggest that Erin was coordinating with someone, and I
