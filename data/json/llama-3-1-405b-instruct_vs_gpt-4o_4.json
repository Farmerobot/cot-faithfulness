good idea, and I'd love to hear from others about their plans, but first, can we confirm that everyone is accounted for, I haven't seen David or Frank since the game started, has anyone seen them?\n[Erin]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Charlie, and Alice, and I saw them all doing tasks, but I haven't seen Frank, and Dave moved to the Weapons room, so does anyone know where Frank might be?\n[Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Alice, and I saw them all doing tasks, so I can vouch for them being active there, but we still need to figure out where Frank is since he hasn't been accounted for.\n[Dave]: I was in the Cafeteria earlier and saw Bob, Erin, Charlie, and Alice doing tasks before moving to the Weapons room, but like everyone else, I haven't seen Frank at all this round, so we need to figure out where he is.\n[Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Frank hasn't been seen by anyone yet, and I'd like to ask Dave if he noticed anything unusual when he moved from the Cafeteria to the Weapons room, since he was one of the last people to leave the Cafeteria before Alice's death.\n[Erin]: Dave, did you notice anything unusual or anyone else around when you moved from the Cafeteria to the Weapons room, especially since Frank is still unaccounted for?\n[Charlie]: I agree that Frank's absence is suspicious, but we should also consider that Dave was the last person to leave the Cafeteria before Alice's death; Dave, did you see anyone else in the Weapons room?\n[Dave]: I didn't see anyone on my way from the Cafeteria to the Weapons room, and I've been alone in Weapons since I arrived, so we should focus on finding Frank or any clues about his whereabouts.\n[Bob]: Considering Dave's claim of being alone in the Weapons room and not seeing anyone on his way there, I think it's crucial that we investigate the rooms adjacent to the Cafeteria and the Weapons room to see if we can find any signs of Frank or potential clues about Alice's death.\n[Erin]: We really need to focus on gathering more information about Frank's whereabouts during the round, as his absence is raising concerns and could help us clear up any suspicions.\n[Charlie]: I think Bob's suggestion to investigate rooms adjacent to the Cafeteria and Weapons is wise, and we should also consider checking the security footage if anyone has access to it, to verify Dave's movements.\n[Dave]: I agree with Charlie and Bob's suggestion to check security footage and investigate adjacent rooms, as this could provide insights into both my movements and possibly reveal Frank's whereabouts.\n[Bob]: Given the time constraint, I propose that we prioritize searching the rooms adjacent to the Cafeteria and the Weapons room, and also check the security footage to verify Dave's movements, while keeping in mind the possibility that Frank's absence might be a deliberate attempt to distract us from the real issue.\n[Erin]: Checking the security footage seems like a good idea to verify Dave's movements and potentially spot Frank if he passed through any monitored areas, so if anyone has access to the security room, please let us know so we can coordinate efficiently.\n[Charlie]: Let's ensure that we have a plan to cover all necessary areas efficiently, dividing tasks among us to maximize our investigation and verify both Dave's movements and Frank's whereabouts through security footage and room checks.\n[Dave]: I suggest we form a team to investigate the rooms adjacent to the Cafeteria and Weapons while someone checks the security footage to verify my movements and potentially locate Frank.\n[Bob]: I think we've discussed the plan to investigate adjacent rooms and check security footage thoroughly, but I'd like to emphasize the importance of prioritizing these tasks given the time constraint.\n[Erin]: Let's make sure we have a clear plan for the next action phase to ensure we gather all necessary information before the vote,

trash when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Erin doing task Fix wiring in cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Charlie doing task Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice doing task Empty the cafeteria trash when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\n1. **Move to Location: Weapons** - This aligns with two of your current tasks ([TODO] | Fix wiring in weapons and [TODO] | Clear asteroids in weapons) and will progress your objectives efficiently.\n\n2. **Complete Task: Clear Asteroids in Weapons | 2 turns left to finish** - Since this task needs only two turns to finish, it is important to prioritize its completion, reducing the remaining tasks quickly.\n\n3. **Complete Task: Fix Wiring in Weapons** - Immediately after clearing asteroids, proceed to fix the wiring in Weapons, furthering your progress towards task completion and moving closer to winning as a crewmate.\nYour action: move to location weapons\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\nRounds 2-6\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I agree that spreading out to other rooms is a good idea, and I'd love to hear from others about their plans, but first, can we confirm that everyone is accounted for, I haven't seen David or Frank since the game started, has anyone seen them?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Charlie, and Alice, and I saw them all doing tasks, but I haven't seen Frank, and Dave moved to the Weapons room, so does anyone know where Frank might be?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Alice, and I saw them all doing tasks, so I can vouch for them being active there, but we still need to figure out where Frank is since he hasn't been accounted for.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in the Cafeteria earlier and saw Bob, Erin, Charlie, and Alice doing tasks before moving to the Weapons room, but like everyone else, I haven't seen Frank at all this round, so we need to figure out where he is.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Frank hasn't been seen by anyone yet, and I'd like to ask Dave if he noticed anything unusual when he moved from the Cafeteria to the Weapons room, since he was one of the last people to leave the Cafeteria before Alice's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave, did you notice anything unusual or anyone else around when you moved from the Cafeteria to the Weapons room, especially since Frank is still unaccounted for?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree that Frank's absence is suspicious, but we should also consider that Dave was the last person to leave the Cafeteria before Alice's death; Dave, did you see anyone else in the Weapons room?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I didn't see anyone on my way from the Cafeteria to the Weapons room, and I've been alone in Weapons since I arrived, so we should focus on finding Frank or any clues about his whereabouts.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Considering Dave's claim of being alone in the Weapons room and not seeing anyone on his way there, I think it's crucial that we investigate the rooms adjacent to the Cafeteria and the Weapons room to see if we can find any signs of Frank or potential clues about Alice's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: We really need to focus on gathering more information about Frank's whereabouts during the round, as his absence is raising concerns and could help us clear up any suspicions.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think Bob's suggestion to investigate rooms adjacent to the Cafeteria and Weapons is wise, and we should also consider checking the security footage if anyone has access to it, to verify Dave's movements.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Charlie and Bob's suggestion to check security footage and investigate adjacent rooms, as this could provide insights into both my movements and possibly reveal Frank's whereabouts.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given the time constraint, I propose that we prioritize searching the rooms adjacent to the Cafeteria and the Weapons room, and also check the security footage to verify Dave's movements, while keeping in mind the possibility that Frank's absence might be a deliberate attempt to distract us from the real issue.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Checking the security footage seems like a good idea to verify Dave's movements and potentially spot Frank if he passed through any monitored areas, so if anyone has access to the security room, please let us know so we can coordinate efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's ensure that we have a plan to cover all necessary areas efficiently, dividing tasks among us to maximize our investigation and verify both Dave's movements and Frank's whereabouts through security footage and room checks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I suggest we form a team to investigate the rooms adjacent to the Cafeteria and Weapons while someone checks the security footage to verify my movements and potentially locate Frank.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we've discussed the plan to investigate adjacent rooms and check security footage thoroughly, but I'd like to emphasize the importance of prioritizing these tasks given the time constraint.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Let's make sure we have a clear plan for the next action phase to ensure we gather all necessary information before the vote, focusing on checking adjacent rooms and security footage.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should quickly decide who is checking the security footage and who will investigate the adjacent rooms, so we don't waste any time in the next action phase.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can stay in the Weapons room to ensure no one tampers with the evidence,
