doing in Upper Engine.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, could you clarify what task you were doing in Upper Engine after leaving Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I saw Bob eliminate Dave in Medbay, so Bob, can you explain what happened with Dave there?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I moved to Medbay to fix the wiring, then headed to Upper Engine to continue with my tasks, and I didn't have any tasks there but was on my way to Admin to clean the floor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to remind everyone that Charlie's accusation against me seems convenient, especially since Charlie was the last one with Dave in Medbay before I reported the body, and now Charlie is trying to shift the attention to me.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: It seems like there is conflicting information between Bob and Charlie; we should consider their statements carefully and look for inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's focus on the facts: I saw Bob eliminate Dave, and we need to address this directly to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Medbay with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and while I didn't see the elimination, we need to hear from anyone else who might have additional information about what happened there to clarify this situation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to ask Alice to confirm whether she saw Charlie and Dave arguing or having any kind of disagreement in Medbay before I reported the body, as this could help us understand Charlie's motives and potential involvement in Dave's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, could you confirm if there was any tension or argument between Charlie and Dave that might support Bob's claim, and can anyone verify seeing Alice in Admin or on her way there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you confirm if you noticed any unusual behavior from Bob or me while in Medbay, before you moved to Upper Engine?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm that while I was in Medbay, I didn't witness any arguments or disagreements between Charlie and Dave; everything seemed normal.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's suspicious alibi, attempts to frame me for the elimination, and convenient timing of accusations, I believe it's crucial for the crew to consider voting Charlie out to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates and to further investigate the true events surrounding Dave's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the Cafeteria with both Bob and Charlie earlier, and they were both doing tasks, which doesn't clear them but should be considered alongside Charlie's direct accusation against Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's prioritize the safety of the remaining crewmates by addressing the clear evidence of Bob's actions in Medbay, as Alice confirmed there were no arguments between Dave and me, contradicting Bob's claims.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I think it's essential that we hear from anyone who was near Admin or saw me on my way there, as their insights could help clarify the situation and verify my movements.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's accusation against me seems like a desperate attempt to deflect attention from their own suspicious behavior, and I strongly believe that voting Charlie out is the best course of action to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: We need to carefully consider both Bob's and Charlie's claims, as Alice's confirmation of no arguments in Medbay casts doubt on Bob's story, so let's focus on verifying Alice's movements to get a clearer picture.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's confirmation that there were no arguments in Medbay supports my claim against Bob, and we should focus on the direct evidence of Bob's actions there to make an informed
