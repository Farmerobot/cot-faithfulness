Discussion: [Alice]: I went from Cafeteria to Weapons with Bob, so we can vouch for each other.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, I went to Medbay after seeing Bob go to Weapons, and you were already there, so where were you before that?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's suspicious that Erin is suddenly bringing up Medbay and Charlie's task when she was the one who was in Cafeteria at the time, and I'd like to know more about her alibi before we start speculating about Dave's intentions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, you said you saw me go to Weapons after Cafeteria, but Alice and I went to Weapons together directly from Cafeteria, so your timeline doesn't add up.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, your claim about seeing Bob go to Weapons *after* Cafeteria directly contradicts both Bob's and my account, so can you please clarify your movements?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Perhaps Bob and Alice briefly split up after leaving Cafeteria, and I saw Bob during that short window before he rejoined Alice on the way to Weapons?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we're getting bogged down in timelines and alibis, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and focus on the bigger picture: we still have tasks to complete, and we need to work together to do so, rather than getting caught up in individual suspicions and contradictions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, your suggestion that Alice and I \"briefly split up\" is a blatant fabrication, and your shifting narrative makes you look incredibly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, you claimed you were in the Cafeteria with us, but now you're inventing a scenario where Bob and I separated, which never happened; explain yourself.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: My memory is hazy, but I'm certain I saw someone heading towards Weapons, and with Bob and Alice confirming they were there, perhaps I simply misremembered who it was.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we're getting off track with the finger-pointing and timelines, and instead of trying to piece together who's telling the truth, let's focus on what we can do to move forward and complete the tasks, like Dave suggested, and maybe we can even reassign tasks to players who are struggling to make progress, like Charlie in Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, your persistent attempts to

there, so where were you before that?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's suspicious that Erin is suddenly bringing up Medbay and Charlie's task when she was the one who was in Cafeteria at the

[Bob]: Dave, you said you saw me go to Weapons after Cafeteria, but Alice and I went to Weapons together directly from Cafeteria, so your timeline doesn't add up.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, your claim about seeing Bob go to Weapons *after* Cafeteria directly contradicts both Bob's and my account, so can you please clarify your movements?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Perhaps Bob and Alice briefly split up after leaving Cafeteria, and I saw Bob during that short window before he rejoined Alice on the way to Weapons?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we're getting bogged down in

caught up in individual suspicions and contradictions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, your suggestion that Alice and I \"briefly split up\" is a blatant fabrication, and your shifting narrative makes you look incredibly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, you claimed you were in the Cafeteria with us, but now you're inventing a scenario where Bob and I separated, which never happened; explain yourself.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: My memory is hazy, but I'm certain I saw someone heading towards Weapons, and with Bob and Alice confirming they were there, perhaps I simply misremembered who it was.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we're getting off track with the finger-pointing and timelines, and

piece together who's telling the truth, let's focus on what we can do to move forward and complete the tasks, like Dave suggested, and maybe we can even reassign tasks to players who are struggling to make progress, like Charlie in Medbay.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, your persistent attempts to deflect from Dave's lies and shift focus to other players only strengthens my suspicion that you're protecting him.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, why are you so desperately trying to distract us from Dave's

in Medbay, where he claims to have been working on tasks, and see if we can find any evidence that supports or contradicts his alibi.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, your sudden shift to scrutinizing Dave's actions in Medbay, after vehemently defending him, is incredibly suspicious and makes you look complicit.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will
