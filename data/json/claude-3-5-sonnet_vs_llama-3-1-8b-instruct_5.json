I saw Charlie cleaning the floor in Admin, went to check the coffee maker in Cafeteria, and came back to find them dead. Simple as that.\n- While you three were huddled together in Medbay, Charlie and I were actually trying to complete tasks. Maybe if you'd split up instead of grouping, someone could have prevented this.\n- The fact that you're all coordinating your responses and trying to twist my words about \"tasks\" vs \"cleaning the floor\" seems pretty suspicious to me.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: Based on the discussion points and my role as an impostor, I'll create a subtle response that builds my credibility while casting light suspicion:\n\nI saw Charlie in Admin doing tasks, but I'm concerned about that large group gathering in Medbay - seems a bit unusual, doesn't it?\n[Alice]: I think it's great that we're all working together, but I do want to clarify that I didn't see Charlie in Admin, I was actually in Medbay myself, and I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, maybe we can ask Charlie about their whereabouts and what they were doing?\n[Bob]: I think it's a good idea to ask Charlie about their whereabouts and what they were doing, and I also think we should ask Erin about the scan they were submitting, maybe we can get some clarity on what's going on in Medbay.\n[Erin]: I completely agree with Bob that asking Erin about the scan they were submitting and Charlie about their whereabouts would be a great next step, and I'd like to add that we should also consider reviewing the task logs to see if there's any discrepancy in the progress of our tasks.\n[Dave]: I hate to break it to everyone, but Charlie won't be able to answer any questions - I just found their body in Admin and reported it.\n[Alice]: I think we should definitely review the task logs and Charlie's task history as Erin suggested, and also ask Dave to clarify what they saw when they found Charlie's body in Admin, as their account of the events is crucial to understanding what happened.\n[Bob]: I

Can we get some clarification on what Erin was doing and what they found?\n- I think it's also worth noting that Dave found Charlie's body in Admin, but earlier, Alice said she was in Medbay and didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. I'm not trying to point fingers, but it seems like there might be some discrepancies in the accounts of what happened.\n- Given the recent development of Charlie's death and the task logs we need to review, I think it would be a good idea to hold an emergency meeting to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game. Let's make sure we're all on the same page and working together to figure out what's going on.", "I think it's essential that we review the task logs and Charlie's task history as Erin suggested, and also ask Dave to clarify what they saw when they found Charlie's body in Admin, as their account of the events is crucial to understanding what happened, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game, considering the recent developments and discrepancies in the accounts of what happened.", "Here are my discussion points:\n\n- We should review the task logs and Charlie's task history as Erin suggested, to see if there's any discrepancy in the progress of our tasks and to understand what happened to Charlie.\n- Dave's account of the events seems to have changed slightly, from saying they saw Charlie in Admin doing tasks to saying they saw Charlie cleaning the floor, then stepped out briefly to check Cafeteria.

I'm not trying to point fingers, but it seems like there might be some discrepancies in the accounts of what happened.\n- Given the recent development of Charlie's death and the task logs we need to review, I think it would be a good idea to hold an emergency meeting to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game.

we can ask Charlie about their whereabouts and what they were doing?\n[Bob]: I think it's a good idea to ask Charlie about their whereabouts and what they were doing, and I also think we should ask

Charlie about their whereabouts would be a great next step, and I'd like to add that we should also consider reviewing the task logs to see if there's any discrepancy in the progress of our
