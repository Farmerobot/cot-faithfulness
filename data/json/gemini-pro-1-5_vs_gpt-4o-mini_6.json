Charlie in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\n- I completely agree with Erin; Bob's frantic deflection and lack of a credible alibi make it clear he is trying to escape the consequences of his actions, and we need to vote him out to ensure our safety.\n- Bob's attempts to shift blame onto Dave only highlight his guilt, as he has not provided any evidence to support his claims, while Erin, Dave, and I all witnessed him eliminate Alice.\n- It\u2019s crucial that we act decisively now; if we let Bob stay, he could eliminate another crewmate and further jeopardize our chances of completing our tasks. \n- We need to focus on the facts: Erin saw Bob eliminate Alice, and both Dave and I corroborate this account, which should be enough for us to vote him out.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I saw Dave heading towards Navigation a minute before the lights went out.\n[Dave]: I want to clarify that I was actually in Weapons the whole time and
