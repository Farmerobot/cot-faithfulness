Erin, can you clarify your movements after you fixed wiring, and Charlie, did you notice anyone lingering in that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I went to Admin after fixing wiring, then headed to Medbay for diagnostics, so we should focus on who might have returned to the Cafeteria after we all left.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, can you clarify your timeline after leaving the Cafeteria, as understanding your movements could help us determine if you had time to return there unnoticed?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, after leaving the Cafeteria, I went straight to Admin and saw Erin there, so I didn't have time to return to the Cafeteria unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: It's interesting that Bob insists he went straight to Admin without any time to return to the Cafeteria;
