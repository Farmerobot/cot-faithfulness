Given the current situation and available actions, it\u2019s crucial to strike a balance between sabotaging crewmates and avoiding suspicion. Here's the strategic plan:\n\n1. **Pretend Doing Task: Check Catalyzer in Upper Engine** - Start by pretending to do a task to appear as a crewmate going about their duties. Upper Engine is somewhat isolated, so this would look natural if someone happens to enter.\n\n2. **Move to Security** - After pretending to do the task, move to Security. This position will allow you to observe the surveillance cameras and gather information on crewmate movements, providing you with opportunities to coordinate future eliminations or blend in unnoticed.\n\n3. **Observe Movements** - Use the opportunity in Security to watch for other players on the cameras. Take note of isolated players to plan potential eliminations or find moments to create alibis by being seen on camera as a careful player doing their rounds.\n\nEnsure you keep your actions inconspicuous to maintain your position without drawing suspicion from the other players.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Upper Engine\n- report dead body of Charlie\n- report dead body of Bob\n- move to location Reactor\n- move to location Security\n- move to location Medbay\n- pretend doing task: Check catalyzer in upper engine\n- pretend doing task: Replace compression coil in upper engine\n"], "actions": ["wait in Upper Engine", "report dead body of Charlie", "report dead body of Bob", "move to location Reactor", "move to location Security", "move to location Medbay", "pretend doing task: Check catalyzer in upper engine", "pretend doing task: Replace compression coil in upper engine"], "response": "6", "action_result": "You [Alice] pretended [TODO] | Check catalyzer in upper engine", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "You are alone in the room", "observations": [], "chat_messages": []}, {"location": "Upper Engine", "stage": "Discuss", "life": "Alive", "tasks": [{"name": "Eliminate all crewmates", "completed": false, "location": "Unknown"}], "llm_responses": ["- I was in Admin for a while, and it was pretty quiet.

clarify, were Bob and Charlie together in Upper Engine before you found the bodies, or did you see them separately and at different times?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: To avoid wrongful accusations, let's meticulously compare everyone's timelines around the time of the discovery in Upper Engine, focusing on specific locations and times.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Bob and Charlie in Upper
