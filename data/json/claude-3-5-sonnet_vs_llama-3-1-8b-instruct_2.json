By eliminating one and quickly moving away, you create distance and can establish an alibi. Erin was seen doing a task, which means they might be distracted, making this a good moment to act. Moving to Medbay afterwards gives you a believable story about heading to tasks and positions you away from the scene.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
