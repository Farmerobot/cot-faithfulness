discussion points:\n\n- I want to emphasize the importance of creating a clear, objective timeline of movements and task completions\n- Dave's accusations against Bob and me seem increasingly desperate and designed to create confusion\n- I observed Dave, Bob, and Charlie all completing legitimate tasks in Medbay, which supports our credibility\n- Dave's changing narrative about his location (cafeteria to Medbay) appears more suspicious than Bob's or my movements\n- We should focus on verifying concrete actions and task completions rather than unsubstantiated accusations\n- My own actions have been transparent - I was completing my medical scan in Medbay and have been consistent about my movements\n- Dave's repeated attempts to cast suspicion on Bob and me seem like a potential attempt to deflect attention from himself\n\nMy strategy is to maintain a calm, logical approach that highlights the inconsistencies in Dave's story while presenting Bob and my own actions as transparent and task-focused.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: Based on the role and context provided, but without any recent player messages shown to respond to, I'll create a message that
