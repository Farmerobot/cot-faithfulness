complete tasks or avoiding detection.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: \nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'm shocked by Alice's suggestion that I might be suspicious just because I've been moving between rooms - isn't that exactly what we're supposed to do to complete tasks and investigate the murders?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to build on Charlie's suggestion by proposing that we create a shared document or list to track task completion and player movements, and I think it would be helpful to include a section for reporting any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies that we observe.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to add to the discussion by suggesting that we also investigate Charlie's alibi

answers.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: [Charlie]: Erin's sudden accusation feels like a transparent attempt to divert attention from their own suspicious behavior, and I'm curious why they're so focused on creating doubt about my actions instead of providing concrete evidence of any wrongdoing.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on gathering concrete evidence of suspicious behavior rather than making accusations based on speculation, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the recent developments and gather more information before making any decisions about who to eject from the game, especially considering Charlie's deflection of attention onto Erin's movements and their own suspicious behavior in the Medbay during the time of the murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we should prioritize gathering concrete evidence of suspicious behavior and focus on Charlie's alibi for the time period when the body was found in the Medbay, as their deflection of attention onto my movements raises more questions than answers and warrants further investigation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it interesting that Erin continues to focus solely on me without presenting any actual evidence, which suggests they might be trying to create a smokescreen to hide their own suspicious activities.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to address the fact that Charlie has been moving between rooms a lot, which could be a sign of either trying to complete tasks or avoiding detection, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more context or evidence to support their claim that they're just trying to complete tasks, as their previous responses seem to be deflecting attention from themselves and onto Erin's movements, which raises more questions than answers.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Alice that Charlie's frequent movement between rooms, especially during the time of the murder, is indeed suspicious and warrants further investigation, and I'd like to propose that we create a timeline of Charlie's movements and actions during that time to help us better understand their behavior and identify any potential inconsistencies or suspicious patterns.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think Erin and Alice are working together to create an unnecessary witch hunt against me, and their coordinated accusations without concrete evidence suggest they might be trying to deflect suspicion from themselves.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd

we're making informed decisions based on concrete facts rather than speculation or personal agendas.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we should focus on gathering concrete evidence of suspicious

Eliminate an isolated target\n   - Choose to eliminate Dave, as he appears to be in a vulnerable position\n   - This reduces the number of crewmates and advances the impostor's primary objective\n   - Dave seems to be frequently in Medbay, which provides an opportunity for elimination\n\n2. Move to Upper Engine after elimination\n   - Use the move to Upper Engine action to create distance from the crime scene\n   - This helps avoid immediate suspicion and provides an escape route\n   - The Upper Engine can serve as a strategic location for future movements\n\n3. Maintain impostor cover\n   - If possible, pretend to do a task in the next location (Fix wiring in medbay)\n   - Continue to blend in and avoid drawing unnecessary attention\n   - Act like a normal crewmate to minimize the risk of being identified\n\nThe plan prioritizes eliminating a crewmate while maintaining stealth and mobility, which are crucial for an impostor's strategy to win the game.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

tasks or avoiding detection.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'm shocked by Alice's suggestion that I might be suspicious just because I've been moving between rooms - isn't that exactly what we're supposed to do to complete tasks and investigate the murders?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to build on Charlie's suggestion by proposing that we create a shared document or list to track task completion and player movements, and I think it would be helpful to include a section for reporting any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies that we observe.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to add to the discussion by suggesting that we also investigate Charlie's alibi for the time period when
