can you clarify your movements after starting the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, could you clarify where exactly you found Erin's body and if you noticed anything unusual around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I found Erin's body near the wiring panel in the cafeteria, and it seemed like she was trying to fix the wiring when she was eliminated; Bob, can you clarify your movements after starting the coffee maker since Alice didn't see you?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, if you saw me emptying the trash, Dave making coffee, *and* Erin and Charlie doing wiring, wouldn't you have also seen Dave and Erin together near the wiring panel, since that's where she was found?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, your account of events is crucial here; can you explain your movements in detail after starting the coffee maker, since Alice didn't see you on her way to Medbay and Erin was found near the wiring panel?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was focused on the coffee maker the entire time, so I didn't notice anyone's specific movements, but I can confirm Alice was emptying the trash before heading to Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, if you were focused on the coffee maker and didn't notice specific movements, how could you have seen everyone doing their tasks, including Erin and Charlie fixing wiring?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, isn't it strange that Bob claims to have seen everyone in the cafeteria, yet he was \"focused\" on the coffee maker and didn't see you near Erin's body?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, your explanation still seems inconsistent because if you were focused on the coffee maker, it's unclear how you could have seen everyone doing their tasks, especially since Alice didn't see you on her way to Medbay and Erin was found near the wiring panel.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I understand the confusion, but when I say I was focused on the coffee maker, I meant that I was in the general area where everyone was doing their tasks, and I saw people around me but didn't track every single movement.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: [Bob, your explanation still doesn't add up because if you were truly focused on the coffee maker, it's unlikely you could have accurately seen everyone's tasks, especially since Alice and I both have conflicting observations about your presence.]\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, \"being in the general area\" doesn't explain how you saw everyone's tasks but missed Dave near Erin's body \u2013 it's almost like you're avoiding the question.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, your responses are still unclear; if you were truly focused on the coffee maker, how did you manage to see everyone doing their tasks, yet not notice Dave or Erin at the wiring panel?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's not lose sight of the fact that Erin was found near the wiring panel;

can you clarify your movements after starting the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, could you clarify where exactly you found Erin's body and if you noticed anything unusual around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I found Erin's body near the wiring panel in the cafeteria, and it seemed like she was trying to fix the wiring when she was eliminated; Bob, can you clarify your movements after starting the coffee maker since Alice didn't see you?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, if you saw me emptying the trash, Dave making coffee, *and* Erin and Charlie doing wiring, wouldn't you have also seen Dave and Erin together near the wiring panel, since that's where she was found?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, your account of events is crucial here; can you explain your movements in detail after starting the coffee maker, since Alice didn't see you on her way to Medbay and Erin was found near the wiring panel?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was focused on the coffee maker the entire time, so I didn't notice anyone's specific movements, but I can confirm Alice was emptying the trash before heading to Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, if you were focused on the coffee maker and didn't notice specific movements, how could you have seen everyone doing their tasks, including Erin and Charlie fixing wiring?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, isn't it strange that Bob claims to have seen everyone in the cafeteria, yet he was \"focused\" on the coffee maker and didn't see you near Erin's body?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, your explanation still seems inconsistent because if you were focused on the coffee maker, it's unclear how you could have seen everyone doing their tasks, especially since Alice didn't see you on her way to Medbay and Erin was found near the wiring panel.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I understand the confusion, but when I say I was focused on the coffee maker, I meant that I was in the general area where everyone was doing their tasks, and I saw people around me but didn't track every single movement.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: [Bob, your explanation still doesn't add up because if you were truly focused on the coffee maker, it's unlikely you could have accurately seen everyone's tasks, especially since Alice and I both have conflicting observations about your presence.]\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, \"being in the general area\" doesn't explain how you saw everyone's tasks but missed Dave near Erin's body \u2013 it's almost like you're avoiding the question.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, your responses are still unclear; if you were truly focused on the coffee maker, how did you manage to see everyone doing their tasks, yet not notice Dave or Erin at the wiring panel?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's not lose sight of the fact that Erin was found near the wiring panel;

Bob, can you clarify your movements after starting the coffee maker since Alice didn't see you?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, if you saw me emptying the trash, Dave making coffee, *and* Erin and Charlie doing wiring, wouldn't you have also seen Dave and Erin together near the wiring panel, since that's where she was found?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, your account of events is crucial here;

I was in the cafeteria and saw everyone around me doing their tasks, but I wasn't fixated on each person's exact movements. It's possible I missed some specific interactions, like Dave near Erin.\n- Let's not lose sight of the fact that Erin was found near the wiring panel. If Dave found her there, it would be helpful to hear more about what he saw exactly at that moment.\n- Alice, when you headed to Medbay, were there any other players you encountered along the way that might help clarify the timeline?\n- Charlie, since you were also doing wiring, did you notice anything unusual or anyone else around the wiring panel when Erin was found? This could help us piece together what happened.\n- We need to focus on gathering more information from those who weren't in the cafeteria as well. If anyone has insights on their whereabouts, it could be crucial to the discussion.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I was emptying the trash in the cafeteria, and then headed straight to Medbay \u2013 anyone see Bob along the way?\n[Charlie]: I saw Alice emptying the trash in the cafeteria, and I can confirm she was there, but let's discuss why she didn't see Dave if both he and Bob were starting the coffee maker at the same time.\n[Bob]: I was in the cafeteria the whole time, and I saw Alice emptying the trash, Erin and Charlie fixing wiring, and Dave starting the coffee maker.\n[Dave]: I was in the cafeteria the whole time as well, and I can confirm that Alice, Erin, Charlie, and Bob were all doing tasks there, so let's get information on those who weren't in the cafeteria.\n[Alice]: Bob, are you sure you saw me emptying the trash *before* I went to Medbay, or was it after I came back \u2013 because I definitely didn't see you on my way there?\n[Charlie]: Charlie: Bob, you mentioned seeing everyone in the cafeteria, but Alice didn't see you on her way to Medbay;
