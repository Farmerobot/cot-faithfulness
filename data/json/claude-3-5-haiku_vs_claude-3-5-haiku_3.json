After completing the Cafeteria wiring, move to Medbay to work on the wiring task there, as it's one of the nearby locations with an available action.\n\n3. During movement and task completion, stay alert and observe the behavior of other players in the room, particularly noting any suspicious activities that might indicate impostor behavior.\n\n4. If possible, communicate with other crewmates about task progress and coordinate efforts to complete objectives efficiently.\n\nThe plan focuses on methodically working through the available tasks while maintaining situational awareness, which is crucial for crewmate survival and task completion.\nYour action: complete task: fix wiring in cafeteria\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Charlie]\n\n\nYour Current Objectives:\n['[TODO] | Water plants in o2', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in electrical', '[TODO] | Check catalyzer in lower engine', '[TODO] | Empty the storage trash chute', '[TODO] | Clean oxygenator filter in o2', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in medbay', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in o2', '[TODO] | Process data in communications | 2 turns left to finish', '[TODO] | Align engine output in upper engine | 2 turns left to finish']\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

Complete the wiring task in Medbay, which is currently an available action and will help progress towards the team's task objectives.\n\n2. After completing the Medbay wiring, be cautious of Erin's presence, as you witnessed her eliminating Alice in the previous round, which suggests suspicious impostor behavior.\n\n3.
