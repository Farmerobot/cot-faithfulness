happened in Medbay before we jump to conclusions.\n- I was in Medbay with Charlie and Dave, and I didn't notice anything unusual about their behavior, but I did see Bob moving around Medbay and Upper Engine, which seemed suspicious to me.\n- I think Bob's suggestion to investigate Charlie's actions in Medbay is a good idea, but we should also consider the fact that Bob was one of the last people to see Charlie and Dave alive, and maybe they can provide more insight into what happened.\n- I agree with Erin that the timing of Charlie's elimination is suspicious, but I think it's unfair to imply that I had anything to do with it just because I mentioned needing help in Medbay earlier.\n- I think we should focus on gathering more information and discussing the facts before we start making

Medbay might have resources or tasks that you can work on.\n2. **Complete task: Process data in communications | 2 turns left to finish**: If you're going to move to Medbay, you might as well try to complete this task while you're in Communications. This will get one task out of the way and make progress on an objective.\n3. **Wait in Medbay for a bit**: Once you're in Medbay, take a moment to wait and see if anything develops.

You might overhear some valuable information or see something that could help you identify the impostor.\n2. **Report dead body of Dave**: If you wait and observe for a bit, you might be able to gather some information. However, since you've already seen Alice eliminate Dave, it's crucial to report the dead body. This will create a discussion opportunity and might help identify the impostor.\n3. **Move to location Cafeteria**: After reporting the dead body, consider moving to the Cafeteria. You've seen Alice move to Medbay, and it's possible she might have gone there to eliminate someone. You can try to investigate the Cafeteria and see if there's any suspicious activity or clues.\n4. **Evaluate and adjust**: After moving to the Cafeteria, re-evaluate the situation and decide whether to continue working on tasks, move to another location, or take another action.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

If she becomes hostile or suspicious, we can become cautious and consider reporting her.\n4. **Report dead body if necessary**: If we suspect that Alice might be a hostile player, we can report her dead body if she gets eliminated or is confirmed to be an impostor.\n\nThis plan focuses on completing a priority task, building trust, and observing a potentially hostile player.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that investigating Charlie's actions in Medbay is crucial, and I'd like to add that I think it's also essential to consider the timing of Charlie's elimination, as

like to clarify that I was indeed in Medbay during Charlie's elimination, as I mentioned earlier, but I didn't see Erin leave her post in Cafeteria, which seems suspicious given the timing of

Bob's actions in Medbay during Charlie's elimination, and I'd like to request that we continue to discuss this topic until we have a clear understanding of what happened.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I'd love to hear from Charlie about what's taking so long in Medbay, and maybe we can offer some help if they're struggling with a task?\n[Bob]: I think it's a good idea to consider Charlie's actions in Medbay before they were eliminated, and I'd like to ask Alice if she noticed anything unusual about Charlie's behavior while they were in Medbay, as it could be a crucial clue to figuring out what happened.\n[Erin]: I agree with Bob that investigating Charlie's actions in Medbay is crucial, and I'd like to add that I think it's also essential to consider the timing of Charlie's elimination, as it seems suspicious that they were eliminated right after Alice mentioned needing help in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice if she noticed anything unusual about Charlie's behavior around that time.\n[Alice]: I understand that some of you are suspicious of me, but I assure you that I'm just as concerned about the eliminations as the rest of you, and I think we should focus on gathering more information about Bob's whereabouts during the time Charlie and Dave were eliminated, rather than making assumptions about me based on a coincidence.\n[Bob]: I'd like to clarify that I was indeed in Medbay during Charlie's elimination, as I mentioned earlier, but I didn't see Erin leave her post in Cafeteria, which seems suspicious given the timing of Charlie's elimination and Erin's comment about needing help in Medbay.\n[Erin]: I'd like to ask Bob to clarify his statement about not seeing me leave the cafeteria, as it seems like a crucial point in understanding the timeline of events, and I'd appreciate it if he could provide more details about what he was doing and what he saw during that time.\n[Alice]: I'd like to reiterate that Bob's attempt to shift the focus to Erin seems suspicious, and I think it's essential that he provides more details about his actions in Medbay during Charlie's elimination, rather than just making claims about Erin's whereabouts.\n[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate that I was in Medbay during Charlie's elimination and noticed Alice seemed to be in a hurry to eliminate them, which I think deserves further investigation, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her actions in Medbay during that time.\n[Erin]: I think it's essential to focus on gathering more information about Bob's actions in Medbay during Charlie's elimination, and I'd like to ask him to provide a detailed timeline of his activities, including the exact time he arrived in Medbay, what he was doing, and who he interacted with, as this will help us get a clearer picture of what happened and determine whether his alibi checks out.\n[Alice]: I'd like to point out that Bob's latest statement about me being in a hurry to eliminate Charlie is not only unfounded but also a clear attempt to deflect attention from his own suspicious behavior in Medbay, and I think it's time for him to provide concrete evidence to support his claims rather than relying on baseless accusations.\n[Bob]: I'd like to clarify that my previous statements about being in Medbay during Charlie's elimination were not meant to deflect attention from myself, but rather to provide a factual account of my actions, and I'm happy to provide a detailed timeline of my activities in Medbay, including the exact time I arrived, what I was doing, and who I interacted with, to help clear up any confusion and ensure that we're focusing on the facts rather than speculation.\n[Erin]: I'd like to ask Bob to provide a detailed timeline of his activities in Medbay during Charlie's elimination, including the exact time he arrived, what he was doing, and who he interacted with, as this will help us get a clearer picture of what happened and determine whether his alibi checks out, and I'd also like to request that he provides concrete evidence to support his claims, rather than relying on baseless accusations.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Bob is now willing to provide a detailed timeline of his activities in Medbay, but I'd like to point out that this sudden willingness to cooperate seems like a desperate attempt to cover his tracks, and I believe we should scrutinize his alibi even more closely to ensure he's not trying to deceive us.\n[Bob]: I'd like to provide a detailed timeline of my activities in Medbay during
