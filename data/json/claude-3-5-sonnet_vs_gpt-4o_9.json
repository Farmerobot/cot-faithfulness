Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on the given role and discussion points, I'll create a response that helps maintain cover while subtly directing suspicion:\n\nI can vouch for Dave doing wiring tasks in both Cafeteria and Reactor, but I'm concerned that Bob hasn't been seen since heading to Weapons early on.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I've seen Bob doing tasks in Weapons and Navigation, so it seems he has been actively working on tasks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was indeed in Weapons earlier, focusing on calibrating the targeting system and fixing wiring, and I didn't see anyone else there until Erin arrived later.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it strange that Bob and Erin are so quick to confirm each other's alibis when they were nowhere near where Dave's body was found in Reactor.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the Cafeteria with Charlie, Alice, and Dave initially, and I saw both Charlie and Alice move to Medbay, while Dave went to Admin, so none of us were near Reactor when Dave was killed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: If Dave was found in Reactor, we should focus on who was last seen in that area rather than questioning Erin and me, as we were occupied with tasks elsewhere.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I need to correct something - I wasn't in Medbay with Alice as Erin claims, I was actually doing tasks in Reactor where I last saw Dave alive, and I think we should look more closely at who's trying to create false narratives here.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, could you clarify your movements, especially around Medbay, since Charlie's account doesn't match what I observed?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, can you confirm whether you saw Charlie in Medbay or not, as this could help us resolve the inconsistencies in Charlie's story and pinpoint who was actually near the Reactor?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since Alice seems hesitant to respond about the Medbay situation, perhaps we should consider why she's being so quiet when her testimony could clear things up immediately.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, your perspective is crucial here\u2014can you confirm whether you saw Charlie in Medbay or if you were elsewhere, as this could help us resolve the inconsistencies in Charlie's story and determine who was near Reactor?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: We need to hear from Alice to clear up these inconsistencies and focus on those who were last seen near Reactor, as that's where the real issue lies.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since everyone's so focused on Alice's testimony, let me point out that it's quite convenient how Erin keeps trying to shift attention to Medbay when Dave was found in Reactor, where I openly admitted to being.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie's admission of being in Reactor with Dave makes him a prime suspect, especially since he's trying to divert attention away from his own location.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your story keeps changing, and since you were the last one seen with Dave in Reactor, it seems you're trying to deflect blame onto others.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_O2\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Charlie]: Based on the given role and

deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\n- I want to reiterate that Erin and I were consistently working on tasks in Weapons and Navigation, which aligns with the tasks seen and completed.\n- Charlie's admission of being in Reactor with Dave before his body was found is concerning, especially since he initially tried to cast suspicion on others.\n- It seems like Charlie is trying to create confusion by questioning others' movements, particularly between Medbay and Reactor, where he was last with Dave.\n- Alice's silence on the Medbay situation is suspicious, but it's more critical to address Charlie's inconsistencies given his proximity to the crime scene.\n- With Charlie admitting to being in Reactor and trying to deflect, it makes sense to consider him as a prime suspect in Dave's elimination.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: Based on the given role and discussion points, I'll create a response that helps maintain cover while subtly directing
