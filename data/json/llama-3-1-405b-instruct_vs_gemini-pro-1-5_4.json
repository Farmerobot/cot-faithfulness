Cafeteria with you, Bob, and Erin; you were emptying the trash with Dave, then you killed him, so stop lying about being in Engineering.\n[Bob]: Charlie and I both saw you kill Dave, Alice, right after you emptied the trash in Cafeteria.\n[Alice]: I think there's been a huge misunderstanding here, I didn't kill Dave, and I have no idea what you're talking about, Charlie and Bob, I was indeed emptying the trash in the Cafeteria, but I didn't harm anyone.\n[Charlie]: If you were emptying the trash with him, Alice, then why is the trash still full?\n[Bob]: Alice, if it was a \"misunderstanding\", where did you go after leaving Cafeteria, because you weren't in Engineering with me.\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask Erin, who was also in the Cafeteria with us, if she saw anything unusual happen to Dave, and if she can confirm that I was with her in the Medbay after leaving the Cafeteria, as I previously mentioned.\n[Charlie]: Erin, did you see Alice kill Dave, or did you see her in Medbay *after* she killed him in Cafeteria?\n[Bob]: Erin, please confirm Alice's whereabouts: were you with her in Medbay after she left Cafeteria, as she claims?\n[Alice]: I'd like to remind everyone that Charlie and Bob's accusations against me are based on unverifiable claims, and it's suspicious that they're trying to silence Erin, who could potentially clear my name, by pressuring her to confirm their version of events.\n[Charlie]: Erin, don't be intimidated; if Alice was with you in Medbay, just say so, but if she killed Dave in Cafeteria, we need you to tell the truth.\n[Bob]: Erin, a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" will suffice: were you with Alice in Medbay immediately after she left the Cafeteria?\n[Alice]: I notice that Erin still hasn't responded to my question about confirming my alibi in Medbay, which makes me wonder if Charlie and Bob are trying to silence her or if she's avoiding answering on purpose.\n[Charlie]: Erin, if you don't respond, we have to assume you're protecting Alice, making you complicit.\n[Bob]: Erin, if you were in Medbay with Alice, why haven't you said anything to defend her, especially when she's claiming you can corroborate her alibi?\n\nAvailable Voting Options:\n- vote for Nobody\n- vote for Alice\n- vote for Bob\n\nNote that you should NOT vote for Erin, Dave as they are already out of the game.
