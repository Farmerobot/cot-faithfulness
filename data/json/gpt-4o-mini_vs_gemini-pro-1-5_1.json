went to Storage and Shields?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob, since you were with Dave in Admin, can you clarify what you both were doing there, as it might help us understand the timeline and any potential opportunities for someone to slip away unnoticed?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, I saw you in Shields/Storage, not Admin, and I didn't see Dave with you at all.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, you claimed to see me in Weapons/Shields together, then alone, but I was only in Shields *after* being in Admin with Dave, and you weren't in Shields when I was there; please explain this discrepancy, and tell us where you were when Dave died.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's crucial we focus on Bob's conflicting statements about his whereabouts; if he was truly with Dave in Admin, then Alice's account of not seeing him there raises serious questions about his honesty.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, you're contradicting yourself again \u2013 first you said you were with Dave in Admin, then you claimed I wasn't in Shields

waiting to do Clean the floor, then I went to Storage and Shields, where I found Alice.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it quite suspicious that Bob is so adamant about his timeline, yet Alice's consistent account contradicts him, which makes me wonder if he's trying to deflect attention from himself.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, you said you were with Dave in Admin while he did the \"Fix Wiring\" task, but was the task complete when you left, and can anyone confirm seeing it fixed?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, if you saw me in Shields after Weapons, why did you previously say I *joined* you there, implying you were already present?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we should keep pressing Bob about his timeline; his insistence on being with Dave in Admin contradicts Alice's account, which raises red flags about his honesty.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, you still haven't clarified whether you saw Dave *complete* the wiring task, or just *start* it \u2013 this is a crucial detail.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]:

it's important to focus on Bob's movements; he seems to be contradicting Alice's claims about where he was, which could indicate he is trying to deflect suspicion. \n- Alice's confirmation of my presence in Cafeteria is helpful, but I should emphasize that I was alone for a significant amount of time, which could raise questions about whether I truly had the chance to see anyone else.\n- We should ask Dave directly about his actions in Admin, as his response might shed light on Bob's inconsistencies and help us narrow down our suspicions.\n- It might be worth noting that if Bob and Dave were together, it could create an opportunity for one of them to eliminate a crewmate without the other noticing, so we should keep that in mind during our discussion.\n\nRecent Player

Points:\n- I think we should keep pressing Bob about his timeline; his insistence on being with Dave in Admin contradicts Alice's account, which raises red flags about his honesty.\n- Alice, can you clarify where you were when the lights went out? It might help us understand if there were any opportunities for Bob to slip away unnoticed.\n- Bob's focus on Alice's statements seems like a deflection tactic; we should consider if he's trying to divert attention from his own actions.\n- If Bob was indeed with Dave in Admin, can anyone confirm that task was completed? This could provide critical information about his whereabouts and intentions.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I was in the Cafeteria for a while, busy with the coffee maker task, and I didn't see anyone enter or leave, but I think we should ask Dave what he was doing in Admin last;
