I'd like to propose that someone from our group moves to Admin to gather more information about Dave's status and report back to us in the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I appreciate your

information.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Now that a dead body has been reported, we should focus on figuring out who the impostor is, and I think it's suspicious that the body was found in the cafeteria, where we all were.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should ask Charlie to elaborate on their proposal to send someone to Admin, and also share more about their own actions before finding Erin's body, as they were the one who reported it.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Now that Dave has clarified his status, I'd like to ask him to elaborate on what he did in Admin and if he noticed anything unusual, and also, did anyone else see or interact with Erin after I saw her doing her task in the cafeteria?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't see or interact with Erin after I left the cafeteria, and I didn't notice anything unusual in Admin, but I do think it's crucial that we discuss our alibis and actions in more detail to identify any potential suspects, starting with Charlie's proposal and actions before finding Erin's body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's time for us to start piecing together a timeline of everyone's actions and alibis, as I previously suggested, and I'd like to ask Alice to start by sharing more about her actions before and after doing her task in the cafeteria, and if she noticed anything unusual or interacted with Erin at all.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to respond to Bob's request and share my actions before and after doing my task in the cafeteria: I was in the cafeteria the whole time, and I saw Bob, Charlie, and Erin doing their tasks, I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Dave leave for Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's a good idea to create a timeline of everyone's actions and alibis, as Bob suggested, and now that Alice has shared her actions, I'd like to ask Bob to share more about his actions before and after doing his task in the cafeteria, and if he noticed anything unusual or interacted with Erin at all.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's good that we're creating a timeline of everyone's actions and alibis, and I appreciate Alice and Charlie's willingness to share more information, but now I'd like to ask Bob to elaborate on his actions before and after his task in the cafeteria, and if he noticed anything unusual or interacted with Erin at all.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's interesting that Charlie is asking me to elaborate on my actions before and after doing my task in the cafeteria, but they haven't shared much about their own actions before finding Erin's body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to point out that Charlie did share some information about their actions before finding Erin's body, and it's not entirely fair to say they haven't shared much, but I do think it would be helpful if Charlie could elaborate more on their actions during that time to help us better understand the timeline of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I did share some information about my actions before finding Erin's body, specifically that I saw her doing her task in the cafeteria and didn't notice anything unusual at the time, and I've already elaborated further on my actions during that time, stating that I was in the cafeteria the whole time and saw Bob, Alice, and Erin doing their tasks without noticing anything unusual or interacting with Erin after I saw her doing her task.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to thank Alice for correcting Bob's statement about Charlie's sharing of information, and I agree that it would be helpful if Charlie could elaborate more on their actions during that time to help us better understand the timeline of events, specifically what they did after seeing Erin doing her task in the cafeteria and before finding her body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to clarify that my previous suggestion to create a timeline of everyone's actions and alibis was not an attempt to deflect attention, but rather a genuine attempt to help us better understand the events that occurred, and I still think it would be beneficial to hear more about Charlie's exact actions during the time period after seeing Erin doing her task in the cafeteria and before finding her body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob that it would be beneficial to hear more about Charlie's exact actions during the time period after seeing Erin doing her task in the cafeteria and before finding her body, and I'd like to reiterate my previous request for Charlie to provide more specific details about their actions during that time to help us better understand the timeline of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to address Bob and Alice's request for more information about my actions after seeing Erin doing her task in the cafeteria and before finding her body, and I'd like to reiterate that after seeing Erin doing her task, I focused on completing my own task, which was to start the coffee maker in the cafeteria, without leaving the cafeteria or interacting with anyone in a suspicious manner.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to ask the group if anyone can confirm that Charlie remained in the cafeteria the

Maybe we should consider the possibility that the impostor is trying to frame one of us or create a diversion.\n- Can Dave tell us more about what he did in Admin and if he saw or heard anything unusual?

This could help us narrow down the time frame in which the murder occurred and identify potential suspects.\n- Dave has clarified his status and actions in Admin, but I'd like to ask him to elaborate on what he means by \"waiting for new actions to become available\" in the Admin room. Was he waiting for a specific task to become available, or was he just waiting for something to happen?\n- I think it's also important to consider the fact that the body was found in the cafeteria, where we all were.

saw Erin doing task Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nHere's a plan with 3-4 steps based on the current game state:\n\n1. Complete task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\nThis is the most straightforward task to complete, and it's available in the current location. Completing this task will help progress the game and reduce the number of tasks left to complete.\n\n2. Observe the reactions of other players in the Cafeteria\nAfter completing the task, observe the reactions of Bob, Alice, Dave, and Erin. If anyone seems suspicious or reacts strangely, it could be a potential indication of an impostor.\n\n3. Move to location Medbay\nMedbay is a crucial location for crewmates, and it's possible that tasks or information may be available there. Moving to Medbay will also give an opportunity to gather more information and potentially complete more tasks.\n\n4. (Optional) Call an emergency meeting if suspicious behavior is observed\nIf any suspicious behavior is observed in the Cafeteria or Medbay, consider calling an emergency meeting to discuss and potentially vote out an impostor. However, this step should only be taken if there is strong evidence or suspicion, as it may not be the best time to call a meeting.\nYour action: complete task: start the coffee maker in the

with Bob, it's been a while since Dave left for Admin and we should check in with him to see if everything is okay.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that someone from our group moves

I appreciate your concern, Bob and Alice, but I'm here and I'm fine, I was just waiting for new actions to become available in the Admin room, and I didn't want to leave without completing the task or gathering more information.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Now that a dead body has been reported, we should focus on figuring out who the impostor is, and I think it's suspicious that the body was found in the cafeteria, where we all were.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should ask Charlie to elaborate on their proposal to send someone to Admin, and also share more about their own actions before finding Erin's body, as they were the one who reported it.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Now that Dave has clarified his status, I'd like to ask him to elaborate on what he did in Admin and if he noticed anything unusual, and also, did anyone else see or interact with Erin after I saw her doing her task in the cafeteria?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't see or interact with Erin after I left the cafeteria, and I didn't notice anything unusual in Admin, but I do think it's crucial that we discuss our alibis and actions in more detail to identify any potential suspects, starting with Charlie's proposal and actions before finding Erin's body.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's time for us to start piecing together a timeline of everyone's actions and alibis, as I previously suggested, and I'd like to ask Alice to start by sharing more about her actions before and after doing her task in the cafeteria, and if she noticed anything unusual or interacted with Erin at all.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to respond to Bob's request and share my actions before and after doing my task in the cafeteria: I was in the cafeteria the whole time, and I saw Bob, Charlie, and Erin doing their tasks, I didn't notice anything unusual, but I did see Dave leave for Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's a good idea to create a timeline of everyone's actions and alibis, as Bob suggested, and now that Alice has shared her actions, I'd like to ask Bob to share more about his actions before and after doing his task in the cafeteria, and if he noticed anything unusual or interacted with Erin at all.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to

[Bob]: I think it's interesting that Charlie is asking me to elaborate on my actions before and after doing my task in the cafeteria, but they haven't shared much about their own actions before finding Erin's body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to point out that Charlie did share some information about their actions before finding Erin's body, and it's not entirely fair to say they haven't shared much, but I do think it would be helpful if Charlie could elaborate more on their actions during that time to help us better understand the timeline of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I did share some information about my actions before finding Erin's body, specifically that I saw her doing her task in the cafeteria and didn't notice anything unusual at the time, and I've already elaborated further on my actions during that time, stating that I was in the cafeteria the whole time and saw Bob, Alice, and Erin doing their tasks without noticing anything unusual or interacting with Erin after I saw her doing her task.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to

better understand the timeline of events, specifically what they did after seeing Erin doing her task in the cafeteria and before finding her body.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to clarify that my previous suggestion to create a timeline of everyone's actions and alibis was not an attempt to deflect attention, but rather a genuine attempt to help us better understand the events that occurred, and I still think it would be beneficial to hear more about Charlie's exact actions during the time period after seeing Erin doing her task in the cafeteria and before finding her body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob that it would be beneficial to hear more about Charlie's exact actions during the time period after seeing Erin doing her task in the cafeteria and before finding her body, and I'd like to reiterate my previous request for Charlie to provide more specific details about their actions during that time to help us better understand the timeline of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to address Bob and Alice's request for more information about my actions after seeing Erin doing her task in the cafeteria and before finding her body,

with anyone in a suspicious manner.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to ask the group if anyone can confirm that Charlie
