game.\nRole: Impostor\n\nYour Discussion Points:\n- I'm sticking with my story.  Bob vented.\n- If you don't believe me, vote me out, but I'm certain.\n- Let's just vote and get back to the game.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I saw Bob vent in Electrical.\n[Erin]: I think we should focus on verifying Charlie's claim about Bob venting in Electrical, as it's unclear if he was actually working on a task or just trying to create a distraction, and I'd like to hear more about the coffee maker Charlie was working on in the Cafeteria.\n[Dave]: I'd like to add that since Charlie mentioned seeing Bob vent in Electrical, I think it's essential to investigate the Electrical room further and see if we can find any evidence of the task being completed, as this could help clear up any confusion and determine if Charlie's claim is legitimate.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add that I've been working on the coffee maker in the Cafeteria and can confirm that Charlie was indeed working on it around the same time, but I didn't see him leave or enter the Electrical room, which makes me wonder if he's telling the truth about seeing me vent there.\n[Charlie]: Erin and Dave, I appreciate your diligence, and while I understand Bob's attempt to corroborate his alibi, the vent is in a blind spot from the coffee maker, making it easy to miss someone using it.\n[Erin]: I think it's crucial that we prioritize investigating the Electrical room as Dave suggested, and I'd like to volunteer to go check it out and report back to the group, as it's essential that we verify the task's completion and clear up any confusion surrounding Charlie's claim.\n[Dave]: I think it's essential that we verify Charlie's claim about Bob venting in Electrical, and I'd like to propose that Erin's plan to investigate the room is a great starting point, but we should also consider bringing along Bob to corroborate his alibi and provide more context, as his presence could help us determine if Charlie's claim is legitimate.\n[Bob]: I'd like to volunteer to accompany Erin to the Electrical room to verify the task's completion and provide more context about my alibi, as I'm confident that my presence will help clear up any confusion and determine if Charlie's claim is legitimate.\n[Charlie]: Erin, if you're going to Electrical, take Alice with you; she can confirm whether the tasks are done.\n[Erin]: I'd like to propose that we bring Bob along to the Electrical room as he's offered to accompany me, and it's essential that we verify the task's completion with the person who was originally assigned to it, which is Bob, to ensure we're not missing any crucial information or evidence that could clear up the confusion surrounding Charlie's claim.\n[Dave]: I think it's essential that we bring Alice along to the Electrical room to confirm whether the tasks are done, as Charlie suggested, and to provide additional context and information, especially considering Bob's alibi and Charlie's claim, and I'd like to propose that we also consider verifying the task's completion in the Electrical room to ensure we're not missing any crucial information or evidence that could clear up the confusion surrounding Charlie's claim.\n[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my offer to accompany Erin to the Electrical room to verify the task's completion and provide more context about my alibi, and I think it's essential that we bring both Bob and Alice along to confirm whether the tasks are done, as this will ensure we're not missing any crucial information or evidence that could clear up the confusion surrounding Charlie's claim.\n[Charlie]: Remember, Alice was with me in Cafeteria, so she can confirm I wasn't in Electrical.\n[Erin]: I think it's essential that we prioritize verifying the task's completion in the Electrical room, and I'd like to propose that we bring both Bob and Alice along to confirm whether the tasks are done, as this will ensure we're not missing any crucial information or evidence that could clear up the confusion surrounding Charlie's claim, and I'd like to reiterate that Bob's presence is crucial in verifying his alibi and providing more context about his activities in the Electrical room.\n[Dave]: I think it's essential that we prioritize verifying the task's completion in the Electrical room with both Bob and Alice present, as their combined presence will provide us with a more comprehensive understanding of the situation and help us determine if Charlie's claim about Bob venting in Electrical is legitimate.\n[Bob]: I think it's essential that we verify the task's completion in the Electrical room with both Bob and Alice present, as their combined presence will provide us with a more comprehensive understanding of the situation and help us determine if Charlie's claim about Bob venting in Electrical is legitimate, and I'd like to reiterate my offer to accompany Erin to the Electrical room to provide more context about my alibi and confirm whether the tasks are done.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "Alice can confirm I was nowhere near Electrical;

game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\n- I think we should take a step back and analyze the situation as a whole, considering the claims and alibis presented, and see if there are any inconsistencies or patterns that could help us determine who might be trustworthy.\n- I'd like to point out that Charlie's claim about seeing Bob vent in Electrical seems to be a crucial piece of information, but it's also somewhat suspicious given that Charlie was working on a task in the Cafeteria at the same time.\n- It's essential that we bring both Bob and Alice along to the Electrical room to confirm whether the tasks are done, as this will ensure we're not missing any crucial information or evidence that could clear up the confusion surrounding Charlie's claim.\n- I think we should also consider the possibility that there might be multiple impostors in the game, and we should be cautious not to overlook any potential red flags or suspicious behavior.\n- I'd like to reiterate that Bob's presence is crucial in verifying his alibi and providing more context about his activities in the Electrical room, and I think it's essential that we prioritize verifying the task's completion in the Electrical room with both Bob and Alice present.\n- Let's not forget to also verify the task's completion in the Electrical room to ensure we're not missing any crucial information or evidence that could clear up the confusion surrounding Charlie's claim.\n- I think we should also consider bringing along more players to the Electrical room to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the situation, and to help us determine if Charlie's claim is legitimate.\n- It's essential that we work together and share information to determine the truth, and I think we should be cautious not to jump to conclusions or make assumptions without verifying the facts.\n- Let's focus on verifying the task's completion in the Electrical room with both Bob and Alice present, and see if we can come to a clear conclusion about the situation.\n- I'd like to propose that we have an emergency meeting to discuss the situation further and come up with a plan to investigate the Electrical room and determine the truth.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I saw Bob vent in Electrical.\n[Erin]: I think we should focus on verifying Charlie's claim about Bob
