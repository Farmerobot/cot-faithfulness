This will allow me to assess the situation and identify potential vulnerabilities in their behavior or actions.\n2. **Identify a target**: Based on my observations, I'll identify a target to eliminate. If Dave and Bob continue to work together, I may try to wait for a moment when one of them is alone or distracted, making it easier to strike.\n3. **Eliminate a crewmate**: Once I've identified a target, I'll eliminate them. Given the current options, I can eliminate either Dave or Bob. I'll choose the one who seems less prepared or vigilant.\n4. **Pretend to be doing a task**: After eliminating a crewmate, I'll pretend to be doing a harmless task in the Medbay, such as \"fixing equipment\" or \"collecting medical supplies.\" This will help me blend in with the remaining crewmates and avoid raising suspicion.\n\nThis plan focuses on eliminating a crewmate while maintaining a low profile, and I'll adapt to any challenges or opportunities that arise during the game progression.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

The Medbay is a strategic location where I may be able to find potential targets or identify vulnerable crewmates. I'll move to the Medbay to see if there are any opportunities to strike.\n2. **Eject a crewmate after identifying a target**: Once I'm in the Medbay, I'll assess the situation and identify a target to eliminate. This might be a crewmate who is alone or seems unprepared. I'll wait for a suitable opportunity to strike.\n3. **Pretend to be doing a task**: After eliminating a crewmate, I'll pretend to be doing a harmless task in the Medbay, such as \"fixing equipment\" or \"collecting medical supplies.\" This will help me blend in with the remaining crewmates and avoid raising suspicion.\n\nThe plan is straightforward and focuses on eliminating a crewmate while maintaining a low profile.

there.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Alice that we should prioritize our tasks, but I also think we need to be vigilant about our surroundings; I just finished starting the coffee maker in
