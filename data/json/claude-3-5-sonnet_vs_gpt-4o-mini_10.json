Bob's behavior and his attempt to manipulate the narrative, which could indicate he has an accomplice among us.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm that I saw Bob eliminate Erin in Medbay, and

serious accusations without any proof.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob's attempt to question the validity of Alice's claim

Alice claims she saw me eliminate Erin while doing her medbay scan, but that's impossible since the scan task requires full attention - she's clearly lying to frame me.\n", "\nYou are Dave in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\n- Bob's attempts to cast doubt on Alice's claim about seeing him eliminate Erin only further highlight his guilt; we have multiple witnesses, and it's time to act on this evidence.\n- I think it's important to remind everyone that Bob himself admitted to being an impostor, which makes his deflection tactics even more suspicious.\n- We should emphasize that Bob's behavior is a classic sign of an impostor trying to manipulate the narrative to shift blame away from himself and create confusion among us.\n- Bob's

legitimate tasks in both cafeteria and medbay, but I'm concerned about Charlie rushing away from cafeteria without doing anything there.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I find it suspicious that Bob, who openly admitted to being an impostor, is trying to deflect attention onto Charlie while ignoring his own actions and the fact that multiple players were completing tasks together in the cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I appreciate Dave's insight into Bob's deflection tactics, and while I did leave cafeteria to complete my tasks in Weapons, I think it's crucial we focus on Bob's behavior and his attempt to manipulate the narrative, which could indicate he has an accomplice among us.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm that I saw Bob eliminate Erin in Medbay, and despite his attempts to shift blame onto Charlie, we must focus on this evidence to ensure we vote him out and secure our victory.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave and Charlie's quick coordination to build a case against me seems awfully suspicious - are you sure there isn't another impostor working behind the scenes here?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob's desperate attempts to shift suspicion onto me and Charlie only reinforce the evidence against him; we must remain united and vote him out now to protect our team.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's blatant attempts to deflect blame and create confusion only solidify our case against him, and with Alice's confirmation of his actions, it's clear we need to vote him out to secure our victory.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob's admission of being an impostor and his attempts to deflect blame only confirm what I witnessed; we must stand together and vote him out to ensure our success as crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Look, if I really eliminated Erin, then why hasn't anyone found or reported the body yet - seems like Alice is making some pretty serious accusations without any proof.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob's attempt to question the validity of Alice's claim about Erin's elimination only underscores his desperation; we have multiple witnesses, and it's imperative we vote him out to ensure our safety.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's attempts to undermine Alice's testimony and shift blame onto others only highlight his guilt, and with so many of us corroborating the evidence against him, we need to act decisively and vote him out to protect our team.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob's continued deflection and attempt to question my claims only further proves his guilt, and with the support of both Dave and Charlie, we must remain united in our decision to vote him out for the safety of our team.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice claims she saw me eliminate Erin while doing her medbay scan, but that's impossible since the scan task requires full attention - she's clearly lying to frame me.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob's insistence that Alice's claim is impossible only shows his desperation to undermine credible testimony; we have a clear consensus among multiple witnesses, and it's time to vote him out for the safety of our team.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's ongoing attempts to discredit Alice's testimony and shift blame onto others only serve to reinforce

eliminating Erin only reveal his guilt, and with the strong consensus among us, we must vote him out to protect our remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: How convenient that Alice claims to have witnessed my actions in Medbay, yet the scan task requires standing still - I think we all know it's impossible to multitask during a medical scan.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob's continued

victory.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's relentless attempts to cast doubt on Alice's account only further prove his
