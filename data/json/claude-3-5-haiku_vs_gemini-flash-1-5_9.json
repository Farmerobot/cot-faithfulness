This will help us identify any inconsistencies.\n\n-  To aid in timeline creation, let's each state the specific tasks we completed in each location and approximate time spent.  This level of detail is crucial.\n\n-  Since we've established our post-cafeteria locations, let's now concentrate on verifying the tasks completed in those locations. Any discrepancies could be significant.\n\n-  We need to discuss the circumstances surrounding Bob's death in more detail.  Who was near him? What were their tasks?  This information is vital.\n\n-  While task completion is important, solving Bob's death is our priority right now.  A clear timeline will help us identify the impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I was doing the wiring task in the Cafeteria, and I saw Bob, Erin, and Dave working on their tasks as well, so I think we should focus on completing our objectives rather than pointing fingers.\n[Erin]: I saw Bob, Alice, and Dave in the cafeteria working on tasks, and I can confirm that I was also there completing \"Empty the cafeteria trash\" and starting \"Fix wiring\" before Bob was unfortunately eliminated.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Alice and Erin; focusing on task completion and sharing our locations will help us identify any inconsistencies and catch the Impostor.\n[Dave]: I agree we should focus on tasks, but sharing our post-cafeteria locations and observations is crucial to finding the imposter, so let's all share where we went after the cafeteria.\n[Alice]: I moved to Medbay to continue working on tasks, and I think Charlie's suggestion about systematically tracking our movements is a good way to understand what happened to Bob and identify any potential suspicious behavior.\n[Erin]: I agree with Dave's suggestion to share our post-cafeteria movements; after the cafeteria, I went to Medbay and saw nothing unusual, but I'd like to hear where everyone else went to see if we can find any inconsistencies.\n[Charlie]: Following up on our post-cafeteria movements, I went to Weapons after the cafeteria, where I met Dave;  can we systematically compare our locations and observations to pinpoint any discrepancies?\n[Dave]: After the cafeteria, I went to Weapons to complete the asteroid task, and I saw Charlie there;  let's continue sharing our post-cafeteria movements and compare notes to identify any inconsistencies.\n[Alice]: Since I was in Medbay with Erin, can anyone confirm what tasks they saw me working on?
