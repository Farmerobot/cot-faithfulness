staying at the crime scene could be a calculated move to appear innocent\n- We have multiple pieces of evidence against Charlie: 1) Their explicit impostor confession, 2) Following Alice to Medbay, 3) Being found with the body, and 4) Lying about my location to try to discredit me\n- Both Bob and Erin have corroborated my movements from Cafeteria to Weapons, completely disproving Charlie's false claim about me staying in Cafeteria\n- Charlie's story has changed multiple times - first claiming a \"typo\", then lying about my location, and now trying to justify their presence at the murder scene\n- We should vote for Charlie immediately - every minute we waste gives them more chances to eliminate another crewmate\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: Based on my role as an impostor and the need to establish credibility while subtly casting suspicion, I'll respond:\n\nI can vouch for Alice doing the medbay scan, but I'm a bit suspicious that Bob and Dave haven't mentioned what tasks they were working on after leaving cafeteria.\n[Dave]: I think we should all focus on the fact that Charlie literally just revealed themselves as an impostor in their message -

Follow up with \"Fix wiring in medbay\" while in the same location\n\nThis plan prioritizes:\n- Time-sensitive tasks (diagnostics with 2 turns remaining)\n- Efficiency by completing multiple tasks in the same location\n- Moving to a new location where two tasks can be completed\n- Takes advantage of immediately available movement options\n\nI recommend this sequence because it addresses the urgent time limit on the diagnostics task while also setting you up to complete another task in the same location. Moving to Medbay is currently available in your action list, making this plan immediately actionable.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

I notice you have several tasks in Medbay, including wiring and a scan that needs 2 turns to complete, and Medbay is one of the locations you can move to.\n\nHere's your 3-step plan:\n\n1. Move to Medbay to start working on the multiple tasks there\n2. Begin the medical scan (since it requires 2 turns to complete)\n3. While waiting for scan to complete, observe who enters/exits Medbay for additional information\n\nThis plan makes sense because:\n- It targets multiple objectives in one location (wiring and scan in Medbay)\n- The scan task has a time limit (2 turns left)\n- Being in Medbay allows you to potentially progress on two tasks efficiently\n- Staying in one location while completing a multi-turn task is safer than moving around frequently\nYour action: move to location medbay\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\n\n\nYour Current Objectives:\n['[TODO] | Clean oxygenator filter in o2', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in medbay', '[TODO] | Empty the storage trash chute', '[TODO] | Water plants in o2', '[TODO] | Check catalyzer in lower engine', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in electrical', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in admin', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in o2', '[TODO] | Chart course in navigation | 2 turns left to finish', '[TODO] | Submit scan in medbay | 2 turns left to finish']\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Medbay\n- move to location Upper Engine\n- move to location Cafeteria\n- complete task: Fix wiring in medbay\n- complete task: Submit scan in medbay\nPlease note that at the moment you can not go anywhere else than listed in actions.\n\nCurrent Location:\nMedbay\nPlayers currently in Room with you:\nPlayers in room with you: [Charlie, Erin]\n\nCreate a plan with 3-4 steps.\n", "\nYou are Alice in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- wait in Medbay\n- move to location Upper Engine\n- move to location Cafeteria\n- complete task: Fix wiring in medbay\n- complete task: Submit scan in medbay\n\nPlanned Steps:\nBased on your current location in Medbay and the available actions, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1. Start the medical scan task now (since it requires 2 turns to complete)\n2. While waiting for the scan to complete next turn, fix the wiring in Medbay\n3. Complete the scan in the following turn\n\nThis plan is optimal because:\n- It takes advantage of your current location to complete two tasks\n- The medical scan has a time limit of 2 turns, so starting it now is important\n- You can efficiently complete the wiring task while waiting for the scan\n- Both tasks are currently available to perform\n\nThe plan focuses on completing tasks in your current location before moving elsewhere, maximizing efficiency and minimizing unnecessary movement.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Medbay\n- move to location Upper Engine\n- move to location Cafeteria\n- complete task: Fix wiring in medbay\n- complete task: Submit scan in medbay\n"], "actions": ["wait in Medbay", "move to location Upper Engine", "move to location Cafeteria", "complete task: Fix wiring in medbay",
