especially focusing on Erin's trip to Weapons, which seems a bit suspicious to me.\n[Erin]: I understand Alice's concern about my time in Weapons, but I was focused on the urgent asteroid task; perhaps comparing task completion lists would clear up any confusion.\n[Dave]: I saw Alice in the cafeteria doing wiring and then in Medbay, and Bob in Medbay on a task;  let's compare task completion lists to confirm everyone's whereabouts and clear up any suspicions.\n[Alice]: I think Dave's suggestion about comparing task completion lists is a great way to verify everyone's actions and ensure we identify the real threat among us.\n[Erin]: To further clarify my movements, I propose we compare task completion lists and then create a shared timeline of everyone's whereabouts around the time of Bob's death.\n[Dave]: I agree with comparing task lists and creating a timeline;  my observations of Alice and Bob in Medbay support Erin's suggestion of focusing on the time around Bob's
