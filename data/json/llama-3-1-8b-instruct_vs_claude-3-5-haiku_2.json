Alice's claim of being \"concerned\" about Erin directly contradicts what I witnessed in Medbay, where Alice was the one who eliminated Erin, and her current statement seems like a transparent attempt to deflect suspicion.\n[Dave]: I saw Alice eliminate Erin in Medbay, and her current statement is clearly an attempt to cover up her actions, so I strongly recommend we vote to eject her immediately to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Alice]: I'm shocked by the accusations and the rush to judgment, but I think we should focus on verifying the facts and not jump to conclusions based on incomplete information, as we don't know the full context of what happened in Medbay.\n[Bob]: We must vote Alice out immediately, as Charlie, Dave, and I have all witnessed her eliminating Erin in Medbay, and her attempts to deflect suspicion are a clear sign of her being an impostor who wants to avoid ejection.\n[Charlie]: Alice's attempts to appear innocent are clearly a desperate ploy to avoid ejection, and we have multiple consistent eyewitness accounts confirming her elimination of Erin in Medbay.\n[Dave]: We must vote Alice out unanimously, as Bob, Charlie, and I have irrefutable evidence of her eliminating Erin in Medbay, and her current attempts to deflect suspicion only confirm her guilt as an impostor.\n[Alice]: I'm just trying to clarify the situation and understand why everyone is so quick to assume the worst about me, when in fact, I was just trying to help Erin with her task in Medbay and we must have gotten our wires crossed.\n[Bob]: I firmly believe Alice is an impostor, and we must vote her out unanimously to protect the remaining crewmates, as multiple witnesses -

myself, Bob, and Charlie - that Alice eliminated Erin in Medbay\n- Alice's repeated attempts to create confusion and deflect suspicion are classic impostor tactics\n- Her claims of being \"unfairly targeted\" do not change the fact that we all witnessed her eliminating Erin\n- We must prioritize the safety of the remaining crewmates by removing Alice from the game immediately\n- I urge all players to vote Alice out to prevent further potential eliminations of crewmates\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I'm concerned that Erin has been stuck in Medbay for a while, and it's not clear what she's working on; perhaps we should ask her to join the discussion or clarify her task so we can better understand the situation.\n[Bob]: I saw Alice eliminate Erin in Medbay just moments ago, so her statement about being concerned is completely suspicious and contradictory to what actually happened.\n[Charlie]: I completely agree with Bob - Alice's claim of being \"concerned\" about Erin directly contradicts what I witnessed in Medbay, where Alice was the one who eliminated Erin, and her current statement seems like a transparent attempt to deflect suspicion.\n[Dave]: I saw Alice eliminate Erin in Medbay, and her current statement is clearly an attempt to cover up her actions, so I strongly recommend we vote to eject her immediately to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Alice]: I'm shocked by the accusations and the rush to judgment, but I think we should focus on verifying the facts and not jump to conclusions based on incomplete information, as we don't know the full context of what happened in Medbay.\n[Bob]: We must vote Alice out immediately, as Charlie, Dave, and I have all witnessed her eliminating Erin in Medbay, and her attempts to deflect suspicion are a clear sign of her being an impostor who wants to avoid ejection.\n[Charlie]: Alice's attempts to appear innocent are clearly a desperate ploy to avoid ejection, and we have multiple consistent eyewitness accounts confirming her elimination of Erin in Medbay.\n[Dave]: We must vote Alice out unanimously, as Bob, Charlie, and I have irrefutable evidence of her eliminating Erin in Medbay, and her current attempts to deflect suspicion only confirm her guilt as an impostor.\n[Alice]: I'm just trying to clarify the situation and understand why everyone is so quick to assume the worst about me, when in fact, I was just trying to help Erin with her task in Medbay and we must have gotten our wires crossed.\n[Bob]: I firmly believe Alice is an impostor, and we must vote her out unanimously to protect the remaining crewmates, as multiple witnesses -
