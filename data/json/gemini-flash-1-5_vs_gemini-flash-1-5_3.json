He needs to provide a more precise account of what he saw, including timestamps and the actions of others present.  His lack of a solid alibi for himself is suspicious.\n\n- Charlie's corroboration is weak. He needs to clarify what exactly he saw and when.  His statement is currently too general to be considered reliable evidence.\n\n- My presence in Medbay was to complete tasks, as I've previously stated.  The clustering of people in Medbay was a natural occurrence given the number of tasks located there.  Let's focus on inconsistencies in Bob and Charlie's accounts, rather than jumping to conclusions based on circumstantial evidence.\n\n-  Let's vote out Bob.

discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I agree with Alice about focusing on movement patterns, and I can confirm seeing Erin, Charlie, and Alice in Medbay at different times, but I saw Alice eliminate Erin.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I corroborate Alice's Medbay sighting, seeing both Erin and Bob there while completing tasks, and I also witnessed Alice eliminate Erin, but need clarification on Dave's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, your claim that you saw me eliminate Erin is a serious accusation;  can you describe the specific actions you witnessed to support this?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, to clarify, I saw you standing over Erin in Medbay right before she was reported dead;  can you explain your actions immediately before and after that moment?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, given Bob's detailed account of witnessing you near Erin's body, a precise timeline of your movements around that time is crucial to clearing up this serious accusation.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob's accusation lacks specifics and conveniently ignores his own whereabouts during the alleged elimination, making him a far more suspicious candidate for ejection than myself.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, while I understand your skepticism, my account of seeing you near Erin's body before she was reported dead is corroborated by Charlie, and a precise timeline of your movements in Medbay is crucial to resolving this.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, given Bob's corroborated account and the urgency of resolving Erin's death, providing a detailed timeline of your Medbay activities is essential to clearing your name.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob's vague testimony and convenient lack of self-incrimination, coupled with Charlie's weak corroboration and need for clarification, makes him a far more likely suspect than myself.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, your continued evasiveness and failure to

different times, but I saw Alice eliminate Erin.\n[Charlie]: I corroborate Alice's Medbay sighting, seeing both Erin and Bob there while completing tasks, and I also witnessed Alice eliminate Erin, but need clarification on Dave's death.\n[Alice]: Bob, your claim that you saw me eliminate Erin is a serious accusation;  can you describe the specific actions you witnessed to support this?\n[Bob]: Alice, to clarify, I saw you standing over Erin in Medbay right before she was reported dead;  can you explain your actions immediately before and after that moment?\n[Charlie]: Alice, given Bob's detailed account of witnessing you near Erin's body, a precise timeline of your movements around that time is crucial to clearing up this serious accusation.\n[Alice]: Bob's accusation lacks specifics and conveniently ignores his own whereabouts during the alleged elimination, making him a far more suspicious candidate for ejection than myself.\n[Bob]: Alice, while I understand your skepticism, my account of seeing you near Erin's body before she was reported dead is corroborated by Charlie, and a precise timeline of your movements in Medbay is crucial to resolving this.\n[Charlie]: Alice, given Bob's corroborated account and the urgency of resolving Erin's death, providing a detailed timeline of your Medbay activities is essential to clearing your name.\n[Alice]: Bob's vague testimony
