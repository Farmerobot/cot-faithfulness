Move to location Medbay\n   (Since Dave is currently in Medbay and working on tasks, I'll move there to create an opportunity to eliminate him or at least make it seem like I'm working on tasks)\n\n2. Pretend doing task: Run Diagnostics in Medbay (If possible)\n   (Once in Medbay, I'll pretend to work on a task to blend in and avoid raising suspicion)\n\n3. Eliminate Dave (if possible)\n   (If the opportunity arises, I'll eliminate Dave to reduce the number of crewmates and move closer to winning)\n\nNote: The fourth step will depend on the outcome of the previous steps, so for now, I'll focus on the first three steps.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
