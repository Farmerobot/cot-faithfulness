Points:\nBased on the game context and as a crewmate, here are my discussion points:\n\n- I will continue to maintain our consistent narrative that Alice is the impostor, as her story keeps changing and she has made false accusations against Bob\n- Alice's latest attempt to suggest we are conspiring is another desperate deflection tactic, which further confirms her suspicious behavior\n- My direct observation in Medbay confirms Bob was doing his medical scan with me, which directly contradicts Alice's earlier claim about him venting\n- We have multiple consistent testimonies from Bob, Erin, and myself that point to Alice's guilt in eliminating Dave\n- Alice has not provided a credible explanation for her actions and continues to try to cast doubt on our testimonies instead of addressing the evidence against her\n- I recommend we vote Alice out to protect the remaining crewmates and prevent further eliminations\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I saw Bob vent in
