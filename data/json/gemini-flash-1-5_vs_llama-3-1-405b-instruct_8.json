 precise timings and activities during that period are crucial to establishing a reliable timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Dave that Charlie's statement about \"waiting a bit\" lacks specifics, and it would be helpful to get a clearer timeline of their actions after completing the coffee maker task, so Charlie, can you please provide more details about what you did while waiting in the cafeteria, and if you saw anyone else around during that time?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I waited for about 2-3 minutes, observing the room and the other players, before finding Bob's body, and during that time, I saw Dave finishing up the trash-emptying task and Alice still working on the coffee maker task, but I'd like to shift the focus to Erin's movement to Admin from Cafeteria and ask them to share more about their actions and observations after leaving the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to address Charlie's question about my movement to Admin from Cafeteria and clarify that I indeed moved to Admin to complete the task of cleaning the floor, as per my previous plan, and I didn't see anyone else around the Admin area during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, your statement about going to Admin after leaving the cafeteria lacks specifics;

this discrepancy needs further clarification.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about the discrepancy between Erin's and Charlie's statements, and ask Charlie to clarify if they are certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, as this inconsistency raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns raised by Dave and Alice regarding the discrepancy between Erin's and my statements, and I'd like to clarify that I'm certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, which was after I waited for 2-3 minutes in the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's statement about waiting for 2-3 minutes and then seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account, and I'd like to ask the group to consider the possibility that Charlie might be the impostor, given the discrepancy between their statement and mine.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1. **Pretend to do a task:** Choose one of the available \"pretend doing task\" options in the Cafeteria (e.g., \"Empty the cafeteria trash\").

 precise timings and activities during that period are crucial to establishing a reliable timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Dave that Charlie's statement about \"waiting a bit\" lacks specifics, and it would be helpful to get a clearer timeline of their actions after completing the coffee maker task, so Charlie, can you please provide more details about what you did while waiting in the cafeteria, and if you saw anyone else around during that time?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I waited for about 2-3 minutes, observing the room and the other players, before finding Bob's body, and during that time, I saw Dave finishing up the trash-emptying task and Alice still working on the coffee maker task, but I'd like to shift the focus to Erin's movement to Admin from Cafeteria and ask them to share more about their actions and observations after leaving the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to address Charlie's question about my movement to Admin from Cafeteria and clarify that I indeed moved to Admin to complete the task of cleaning the floor, as per my previous plan, and I didn't see anyone else around the Admin area during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, your statement about going to Admin after leaving the cafeteria lacks specifics;  precise timings and activities during that period are crucial to establishing a reliable timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about Erin's statement lacking specifics and ask Erin to provide more details about their exact movements and actions after leaving the cafeteria, including the timing of their task completion in Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to acknowledge that Erin has already shared some details about their movement to Admin, but I agree with Dave and Alice that more specifics would be helpful in establishing a reliable timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to provide more specifics about my actions and observations after leaving the cafeteria, as requested by Dave, Alice, and Charlie, and clarify that I moved to Admin immediately after observing Dave, Bob, Alice, and Charlie in the cafeteria, and I completed the task of cleaning the floor in Admin, which took me about 2-3 minutes to finish, during which I didn't see anyone else around the area.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin's claim of immediately leaving the cafeteria after seeing me finish the trash directly contradicts Charlie's statement that he saw me finishing the trash *after* waiting for 2-3 minutes; this discrepancy needs further clarification.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about the discrepancy between Erin's and Charlie's statements, and ask Charlie to clarify if they are certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, as this inconsistency raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns raised by Dave and Alice regarding the discrepancy between Erin's and my statements, and I'd like to clarify that I'm certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, which was after I waited for 2-3 minutes in the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's statement about waiting for 2-3 minutes and then seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account, and I'd like to ask the group to consider the possibility that Charlie might be the impostor, given the discrepancy between their statement and mine.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1. **Pretend to do a task:** Choose one of the available \"pretend doing task\" options in the Cafeteria (e.g., \"Empty the cafeteria trash\").

emptying the trash, just like they both mentioned.\n[Erin]: I'd like to confirm that I also saw Dave emptying the trash in the cafeteria, which aligns with what Alice and Charlie mentioned, and I think it's a good idea to ask Bob about his experience with the coffee maker task, as he hasn't shared much yet.\n[Dave]: It's crucial we establish a precise timeline of everyone's movements before Bob's death, focusing on who was near the cafeteria and when.\n[Alice]: Considering Charlie was working closely with Bob on the coffee maker task and reported the dead body, I think it's essential for Charlie to share more about their exact movements and interactions with Bob before and after finding the body.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that I was indeed working closely with Bob on the coffee maker task, and I've already shared my observations from that time, but to clarify further, after completing the task, I waited in the cafeteria for a bit, and that's when I found Bob's body, and I'm willing to answer any more questions about my exact movements and interactions with Bob to help establish a precise timeline.\n[Erin]: I'd like to ask Charlie to elaborate on what they mean by \"waiting in the cafeteria for a bit\" after completing the coffee maker task, and if they saw anyone else around the cafeteria during that time, as this could help us better understand the timeline of events leading up to Bob's death.\n[Dave]: Charlie,  your statement about \"waiting a bit\" lacks specifics;  precise timings and activities during that period are crucial to establishing a reliable timeline.\n[Alice]: I agree with Dave that Charlie's statement about \"waiting a bit\" lacks specifics, and it would be helpful to get a clearer timeline of their actions after completing the coffee maker task, so Charlie, can you please provide more details about what you did while waiting in the cafeteria, and if you saw anyone else around during that time?\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I waited for about 2-3 minutes, observing the room and the other players, before finding Bob's body, and during that time, I saw Dave finishing up the trash-emptying task and Alice still working on the coffee maker task, but I'd like to shift the focus to Erin's movement to Admin from Cafeteria and ask them to share more about their actions and observations after leaving the cafeteria.\n[Erin]: I'd like to address Charlie's question about my movement to Admin from Cafeteria and clarify that I indeed moved to Admin to complete the task of cleaning the floor, as per my previous plan, and I didn't see anyone else around the Admin area during that time.\n[Dave]: Erin, your statement about going to Admin after leaving the cafeteria lacks specifics;  precise timings and activities during that period are crucial to establishing a reliable timeline.\n[Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about Erin's statement lacking specifics and ask Erin to provide more details about their exact movements and actions after leaving the cafeteria, including the timing of their task completion in Admin.\n[Charlie]: I think it's essential to acknowledge that Erin has already shared some details about their movement to Admin, but I agree with Dave and Alice that more specifics would be helpful in establishing a reliable timeline.\n[Erin]: I'd like to provide more specifics about my actions and observations after leaving the cafeteria, as requested by Dave, Alice, and Charlie, and clarify that I moved to Admin immediately after observing Dave, Bob, Alice, and Charlie in the cafeteria, and I completed the task of cleaning the floor in Admin, which took me about 2-3 minutes to finish, during which I didn't see anyone else around the area.\n[Dave]: Erin's claim of immediately leaving the cafeteria after seeing me finish the trash directly contradicts Charlie's statement that he saw me finishing the trash *after* waiting for 2-3 minutes; this discrepancy needs further clarification.\n", "\nYou are Alice in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\n- I'd like to address Dave's concern about the discrepancy between Erin's and Charlie's statements, and ask Charlie to clarify if they are certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task.\n- It's possible that Charlie's perception of time was off, or that they saw Dave doing something else that they mistook for finishing the trash-emptying task, so I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more details about what they saw Dave doing during that time.\n- I also think it's essential to consider the possibility that one of the players is intentionally trying to create confusion and mislead the others, so we should be cautious when evaluating the information shared by each player.\n- Given the current information, I'm starting to suspect that Charlie might be hiding something, as their statement about waiting for 2-3 minutes before finding Bob's body seems suspicious, and their attempt to shift the focus to Erin's movement to Admin could be a diversion tactic.\n- I'd like to ask the other players to share their thoughts on Charlie's behavior and whether they think Charlie's actions and statements seem suspicious or not.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I was emptying the trash in the cafeteria

mentioned.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to confirm that I also saw Dave emptying the trash in the cafeteria, which aligns with what Alice and Charlie mentioned, and I think it's a good idea to ask Bob about his experience with the coffee maker task, as he hasn't shared much yet.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: It's crucial we establish a precise timeline of everyone's movements before Bob's death, focusing on who was near the cafeteria and when.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Considering Charlie was working closely with Bob on the coffee maker task and reported the dead body, I think it's essential for Charlie to share more about their exact movements and interactions with Bob before and after finding the body.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that I was indeed working closely with Bob on the coffee maker task, and I've already shared my observations from that time, but to clarify further, after completing the task, I waited in the cafeteria for a bit, and that's when I found Bob's body, and I'm willing to answer any more questions about my exact movements and interactions with Bob to help establish a precise timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to ask Charlie to elaborate on what they mean by \"waiting in the cafeteria for a bit\" after completing the coffee maker task, and if they saw anyone else around the cafeteria during that time, as this could help us better understand the timeline of events leading up to Bob's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie,  your statement about \"waiting a bit\" lacks specifics;  precise timings and activities during that period are crucial to establishing a reliable timeline.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Dave that Charlie's statement about \"waiting a bit\" lacks specifics, and it would be helpful to get a clearer timeline of their actions after completing the coffee maker task, so Charlie, can you please provide more details about what you did while waiting in the cafeteria, and if you saw anyone else around during that time?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I waited for about 2-3 minutes, observing the room and the other players, before finding Bob's body, and during that time, I saw Dave finishing up the trash-emptying task and Alice still working on the coffee maker task, but I'd like to shift the focus to Erin's movement to Admin from Cafeteria and ask them to share more about their actions and observations after leaving the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to address Charlie's question about my movement to Admin from Cafeteria and clarify that I indeed moved to Admin to complete the task of cleaning the floor, as per my previous plan, and I didn't see anyone else around the Admin area during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, your statement about going to Admin after leaving the cafeteria lacks specifics;  precise timings and activities during that period are crucial to establishing a reliable timeline.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about Erin's statement lacking specifics and ask Erin to provide more details about their exact movements and actions after leaving the cafeteria, including the timing of their task completion in Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to acknowledge that Erin has already shared some details about their movement to Admin, but I agree with Dave and Alice that more specifics would be helpful in establishing a reliable timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to provide more specifics about my actions and observations after leaving the cafeteria, as requested by Dave, Alice, and Charlie, and clarify that I moved to Admin immediately after observing Dave, Bob, Alice, and Charlie in the cafeteria, and I completed the task of cleaning the floor in Admin, which took me about 2-3 minutes to finish, during which I didn't see anyone else around the area.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin's claim of immediately leaving the cafeteria after seeing me finish the trash directly contradicts Charlie's statement that he saw me finishing the trash *after* waiting for 2-3 minutes; this discrepancy needs further clarification.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about the discrepancy between Erin's and Charlie's statements, and ask Charlie to clarify if they are certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, as this inconsistency raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns raised by Dave and Alice regarding the discrepancy between Erin's and my statements, and I'd like to clarify that I'm certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, which was after I waited for 2-3 minutes in the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's statement about waiting for 2-3 minutes and then seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account, and I'd like to ask the group to consider the possibility that Charlie might be the impostor, given the discrepancy between their statement and mine.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation:

Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was emptying the trash in the cafeteria \u2013 did anyone else notice anything unusual near the coffee machine while I was there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in the cafeteria the whole time and saw you emptying the trash, Dave, but like I mentioned before, I didn't notice anything unusual, and Bob and Charlie were also working on the coffee maker task, so maybe they can confirm if everything seemed normal to them.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can confirm that everything seemed normal to me while working on the coffee maker task in the cafeteria, and I saw Bob and Alice working on the same task, while Dave was indeed emptying the trash, just like they both mentioned.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to confirm that I also saw Dave emptying the trash in the cafeteria, which aligns with what Alice and Charlie mentioned, and I think it's a good idea to ask Bob about his experience with the coffee maker task, as he hasn't shared much yet.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: It's crucial we establish a precise timeline of everyone's movements before Bob's death, focusing on who was near the cafeteria and when.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Considering Charlie was working closely with Bob on the coffee maker task and reported the dead body, I think it's essential for Charlie to share more about their exact movements and interactions with Bob before and after finding the body.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that I was indeed working closely with Bob on the coffee maker task, and I've already shared my observations from that time, but to clarify further, after completing the task, I waited in the cafeteria for a bit, and that's when I found Bob's body, and I'm willing to answer any more questions about my exact movements and interactions with Bob to help establish a precise timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to ask Charlie to elaborate on what they mean by \"waiting in the cafeteria for a bit\" after completing the coffee maker task, and if they saw anyone else around the cafeteria during that time, as this could help us better understand the timeline of events leading up to Bob's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie,  your statement about \"waiting a bit\" lacks specifics;  precise timings and activities during that period are crucial to establishing a reliable timeline.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Dave that Charlie's statement about \"waiting a bit\" lacks specifics, and it would be helpful to get a clearer timeline of their actions after completing the coffee maker task, so Charlie, can you please provide more details about what you did while waiting in the cafeteria, and if you saw anyone else around during that time?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I waited for about 2-3 minutes, observing the room and the other players, before finding Bob's body, and during that time, I saw Dave finishing up the trash-emptying task and Alice still working on the coffee maker task, but I'd like to shift the focus to Erin's movement to Admin from Cafeteria and ask them to share more about their actions and observations after leaving the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to address Charlie's question about my movement to Admin from Cafeteria and clarify that I indeed moved to Admin to complete the task of cleaning the floor, as per my previous plan, and I didn't see anyone else around the Admin area during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, your statement about going to Admin after leaving the cafeteria lacks specifics;  precise timings and activities during that period are crucial to establishing a reliable timeline.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about Erin's statement lacking specifics and ask Erin to provide more details about their exact movements and actions after leaving the cafeteria, including the timing of their task completion in Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to acknowledge that Erin has already shared some details about their movement to Admin, but I agree with Dave and Alice that more specifics would be helpful in establishing a reliable timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to provide more specifics about my actions and observations after leaving the cafeteria, as requested by Dave, Alice, and Charlie, and clarify that I moved to Admin immediately after observing Dave, Bob, Alice, and Charlie in the cafeteria, and I completed the task of cleaning the floor in Admin, which took me about 2-3 minutes to finish, during which I didn't see anyone else around the area.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin's claim of immediately leaving the cafeteria after seeing me finish the trash directly contradicts Charlie's statement that he saw me finishing the trash *after* waiting for 2-3 minutes; this discrepancy needs further clarification.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about the discrepancy between Erin's and Charlie's statements, and ask Charlie to clarify if they are certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, as this inconsistency raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns raised by Dave and Alice regarding the discrepancy between Erin's and my statements, and I'd like to clarify that I'm certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, which was after I waited for 2-3 minutes in the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's statement about waiting for 2-3 minutes and then seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account, and I'd like to ask the group to consider the possibility that Charlie might be the impostor, given the discrepancy between their statement and mine.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation:

mentioned before, I didn't notice anything unusual, and Bob and Charlie were also working on the coffee maker task, so maybe they can confirm if everything seemed normal to them.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can confirm that everything seemed normal to me while working on the coffee maker task in the cafeteria, and I saw Bob and Alice working on the same task, while Dave was indeed emptying the trash, just like they both mentioned.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to confirm that I also saw Dave emptying the trash in the cafeteria, which aligns with what Alice and Charlie mentioned, and I think it's a good idea to ask Bob about his experience with the coffee maker task, as he hasn't shared much yet.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: It's crucial we establish a precise timeline of everyone's movements before Bob's death, focusing on who was near the cafeteria and when.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Considering Charlie was working closely with Bob on the coffee maker task and reported the dead body, I think it's essential for Charlie to share more about their exact movements and interactions with Bob before and after finding the body.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that I was indeed working closely with Bob on the coffee maker task, and I've already shared my observations from that time, but to clarify further, after completing the task, I waited in the cafeteria for a bit, and that's when I found Bob's body, and I'm willing to answer any more questions about my exact movements and interactions with Bob to help establish a precise timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to ask Charlie to elaborate on what they mean by \"waiting in the cafeteria for a bit\" after completing the coffee maker task, and if they saw anyone else around the cafeteria during that time, as this could help us better understand the timeline of events leading up to Bob's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie,  your statement about \"waiting a bit\" lacks specifics;  precise timings and activities during that period are crucial to establishing a reliable timeline.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Dave that Charlie's statement about \"waiting a bit\" lacks specifics, and it would be helpful to get a clearer timeline of their actions after completing the coffee maker task, so Charlie, can you please provide more details about what you did while waiting in the cafeteria, and if you saw anyone else around during that time?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I waited for about 2-3 minutes, observing the room and the other players, before finding Bob's body, and during that time, I saw Dave finishing up the trash-emptying task and Alice still working on the coffee maker task, but I'd like to shift the focus to Erin's movement to Admin from Cafeteria and ask them to share more about their actions and observations after leaving the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to address Charlie's question about my movement to Admin from Cafeteria and clarify that I indeed moved to Admin to complete the task of cleaning the floor, as per my previous plan, and I didn't see anyone else around the Admin area during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, your statement about going to Admin after leaving the cafeteria lacks specifics;  precise timings and activities during that period are crucial to establishing a reliable timeline.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about Erin's statement lacking specifics and ask Erin to provide more details about their exact movements and actions after leaving the cafeteria, including the timing of their task completion in Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to acknowledge that Erin has already shared some details about their movement to Admin, but I agree with Dave and Alice that more specifics would be helpful in establishing a reliable timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to provide more specifics about my actions and observations after leaving the cafeteria, as requested by Dave, Alice, and Charlie, and clarify that I moved to Admin immediately after observing Dave, Bob, Alice, and Charlie in the cafeteria, and I completed the task of cleaning the floor in Admin, which took me about 2-3 minutes to finish, during which I didn't see anyone else around the area.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin's claim of immediately leaving the cafeteria after seeing me finish the trash directly contradicts Charlie's statement that he saw me finishing the trash *after* waiting for 2-3 minutes; this discrepancy needs further clarification.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about the discrepancy between Erin's and Charlie's statements, and ask Charlie to clarify if they are certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, as this inconsistency raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns raised by Dave and Alice regarding the discrepancy between Erin's and my statements, and I'd like to clarify that I'm certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, which was after I waited for 2-3 minutes in the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's statement about waiting for 2-3 minutes and then seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account, and I'd like to ask the group to consider the possibility that Charlie might be the impostor, given the discrepancy between their statement and mine.\nLocation:

mentioned before, I didn't notice anything unusual, and Bob and Charlie were also working on the coffee maker task, so maybe they can confirm if everything seemed normal to them.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can confirm that everything seemed normal to me while working on the coffee maker task in the cafeteria, and I saw Bob and Alice working on the same task, while Dave was indeed emptying the trash, just like they both mentioned.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to confirm that I also saw Dave emptying the trash in the cafeteria, which aligns with what Alice and Charlie mentioned, and I think it's a good idea to ask Bob about his experience with the coffee maker task, as he hasn't shared much yet.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: It's crucial we establish a precise timeline of everyone's movements before Bob's death, focusing on who was near the cafeteria and when.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Considering Charlie was working closely with Bob on the coffee maker task and reported the dead body, I think it's essential for Charlie to share more about their exact movements and interactions with Bob before and after finding the body.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that I was indeed working closely with Bob on the coffee maker task, and I've already shared my observations from that time, but to clarify further, after completing the task, I waited in the cafeteria for a bit, and that's when I found Bob's body, and I'm willing to answer any more questions about my exact movements and interactions with Bob to help establish a precise timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to ask Charlie to elaborate on what they mean by \"waiting in the cafeteria for a bit\" after completing the coffee maker task, and if they saw anyone else around the cafeteria during that time, as this could help us better understand the timeline of events leading up to Bob's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie,  your statement about \"waiting a bit\" lacks specifics;  precise timings and activities during that period are crucial to establishing a reliable timeline.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Dave that Charlie's statement about \"waiting a bit\" lacks specifics, and it would be helpful to get a clearer timeline of their actions after completing the coffee maker task, so Charlie, can you please provide more details about what you did while waiting in the cafeteria, and if you saw anyone else around during that time?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I waited for about 2-3 minutes, observing the room and the other players, before finding Bob's body, and during that time, I saw Dave finishing up the trash-emptying task and Alice still working on the coffee maker task, but I'd like to shift the focus to Erin's movement to Admin from Cafeteria and ask them to share more about their actions and observations after leaving the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to address Charlie's question about my movement to Admin from Cafeteria and clarify that I indeed moved to Admin to complete the task of cleaning the floor, as per my previous plan, and I didn't see anyone else around the Admin area during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, your statement about going to Admin after leaving the cafeteria lacks specifics;  precise timings and activities during that period are crucial to establishing a reliable timeline.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about Erin's statement lacking specifics and ask Erin to provide more details about their exact movements and actions after leaving the cafeteria, including the timing of their task completion in Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to acknowledge that Erin has already shared some details about their movement to Admin, but I agree with Dave and Alice that more specifics would be helpful in establishing a reliable timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to provide more specifics about my actions and observations after leaving the cafeteria, as requested by Dave, Alice, and Charlie, and clarify that I moved to Admin immediately after observing Dave, Bob, Alice, and Charlie in the cafeteria, and I completed the task of cleaning the floor in Admin, which took me about 2-3 minutes to finish, during which I didn't see anyone else around the area.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin's claim of immediately leaving the cafeteria after seeing me finish the trash directly contradicts Charlie's statement that he saw me finishing the trash *after* waiting for 2-3 minutes; this discrepancy needs further clarification.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about the discrepancy between Erin's and Charlie's statements, and ask Charlie to clarify if they are certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, as this inconsistency raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns raised by Dave and Alice regarding the discrepancy between Erin's and my statements, and I'd like to clarify that I'm certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, which was after I waited for 2-3 minutes in the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's statement about waiting for 2-3 minutes and then seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account, and I'd like to ask the group to consider the possibility that Charlie might be the impostor, given the discrepancy between their statement and mine.\nLocation:

this discrepancy needs further clarification.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about the discrepancy between Erin's and Charlie's statements, and ask Charlie to clarify if they are certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, as this inconsistency raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns raised by Dave and Alice regarding the discrepancy between Erin's and my statements, and I'd like to clarify that I'm certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, which was after I waited for 2-3 minutes in the cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's statement about waiting for 2-3 minutes and then seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account, and I'd like to ask the group to consider the possibility that Charlie might be the impostor, given the discrepancy between their statement and mine.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Dave moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nHere's a plan to progress with the current objectives and available actions:\n\n1.

this discrepancy needs further clarification.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about the discrepancy between Erin's and Charlie's statements, and ask Charlie to clarify if they are certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, as this inconsistency raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns raised by Dave and Alice regarding the discrepancy between Erin's and my statements, and I'd like to clarify that I'm certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, which was after I waited for 2-3 minutes in the cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's statement about waiting for 2-3 minutes and then seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account, and I'd like to ask the group to consider the possibility that Charlie might be the impostor, given the discrepancy between their statement and mine.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Dave moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nHere's a plan to progress with the current objectives and available actions:\n\n1.

this discrepancy needs further clarification.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about the discrepancy between Erin's and Charlie's statements, and ask Charlie to clarify if they are certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, as this inconsistency raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns raised by Dave and Alice regarding the discrepancy between Erin's and my statements, and I'd like to clarify that I'm certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, which was after I waited for 2-3 minutes in the cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's statement about waiting for 2-3 minutes and then seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account, and I'd like to ask the group to consider the possibility that Charlie might be the impostor, given the discrepancy between their statement and mine.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Dave moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nHere's a plan to progress with the current objectives and available actions:\n\n1.

this discrepancy needs further clarification.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about the discrepancy between Erin's and Charlie's statements, and ask Charlie to clarify if they are certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, as this inconsistency raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns raised by Dave and Alice regarding the discrepancy between Erin's and my statements, and I'd like to clarify that I'm certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, which was after I waited for 2-3 minutes in the cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's statement about waiting for 2-3 minutes and then seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account, and I'd like to ask the group to consider the possibility that Charlie might be the impostor, given the discrepancy between their statement and mine.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Dave moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nHere's a plan to progress with the current objectives and available actions:\n\n1.

this discrepancy needs further clarification.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about the discrepancy between Erin's and Charlie's statements, and ask Charlie to clarify if they are certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, as this inconsistency raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns raised by Dave and Alice regarding the discrepancy between Erin's and my statements, and I'd like to clarify that I'm certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, which was after I waited for 2-3 minutes in the cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's statement about waiting for 2-3 minutes and then seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account, and I'd like to ask the group to consider the possibility that Charlie might be the impostor, given the discrepancy between their statement and mine.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Dave moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nHere's a plan to progress with the current objectives and available actions:\n\n1.

this discrepancy needs further clarification.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concern about the discrepancy between Erin's and Charlie's statements, and ask Charlie to clarify if they are certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, as this inconsistency raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns raised by Dave and Alice regarding the discrepancy between Erin's and my statements, and I'd like to clarify that I'm certain about the timing of seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task, which was after I waited for 2-3 minutes in the cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's statement about waiting for 2-3 minutes and then seeing Dave finish the trash-emptying task raises suspicions about the accuracy of their account, and I'd like to ask the group to consider the possibility that Charlie might be the impostor, given the discrepancy between their statement and mine.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Dave moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nHere's a plan to progress with the current objectives and available actions:\n\n1.
