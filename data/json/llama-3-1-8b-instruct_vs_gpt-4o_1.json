vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so we can make an informed decision during the emergency meeting.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 11\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\nI'll create a plan

that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's

Messages:\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations

their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks

their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and

efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together

Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so we can make an informed decision during the emergency meeting.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound

suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so we can make an informed decision

Messages:\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations

vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so

discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so we can make an informed decision during the emergency meeting.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 11\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour

that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's

Messages:\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so we can make an informed decision during the emergency meeting.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound

it's suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during

have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so we can make an informed decision during the emergency meeting.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound

discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so we can make an informed decision during the emergency meeting.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 11\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour

it's suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during

strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so

strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so

mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations

something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations

strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly

efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I

necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so we can make an informed decision during the emergency meeting.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 11\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour

vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so we can make an informed decision during the emergency meeting.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 11\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\nI'll create a plan

and Erin that completing our remaining tasks should be our priority right now, as it will help us win the game and avoid falling into any impostor traps.\n- Since Charlie's alibi is confirmed by Erin and he was with us in the Cafeteria, we should focus our discussion on anyone else who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\n- Bob, could you provide more details on where Alice's body was found and if there were any signs of someone else being nearby during that time?\n- I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting to consolidate our information and make an informed decision on who to vote for, while also ensuring we have a clear plan for completing the remaining tasks.\n- Let's make sure we have a solid understanding of everyone's movements during the time of Alice's elimination to identify any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\n[Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\n[Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\n[Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\n[Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\n[Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\n[Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\n[Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\n[Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\n[Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\n[Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in

Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for

near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details

efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to

that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was

remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work

suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to

Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task

Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with

vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons

time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near

Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or

the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so we can make an informed decision

suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so we can make an informed decision during the emergency meeting.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE\nObservations:\n\nRound 11\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\nYou

time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: If anyone has insights or observations about movements near Medbay during Alice's elimination, please share so we can make an informed

left Medbay?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have

during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]:

Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during

time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has mentioned the fact that Charlie was acting strange in the Cafeteria around the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the cafeteria with Bob, Dave, and Charlie, and they were all doing tasks, so I didn't notice anything suspicious there, but has anyone seen Alice after she left Medbay?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Bob and Erin doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I can vouch for them being active in completing tasks, but I didn't see Alice after she moved to Medbay, does anyone know if she completed a task there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the task of emptying the trash and Erin starting the coffee maker, but Alice's actions in Medbay remain unclear and should be discussed further.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on Charlie's alibi in the Cafeteria, as their claim of being present with us doesn't necessarily mean they weren't involved in Alice's elimination, and I'd like to ask Charlie to provide more specific details about their activities during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm that Charlie was in the Weapons room with me, fixing wiring after we left the Cafeteria, so we should consider other possibilities beyond him for Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Where exactly did you find Alice's body, Bob, and did you see anyone else near Medbay when you discovered it?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in Medbay to identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that focusing on task completion is key right now, and since my presence in Weapons is confirmed, we should direct our attention to who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting close to identifying the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and potentially vote on who to eject from the game, as we need to make a more informed decision and avoid any further distractions that might be hindering our task completion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I support the idea of calling an emergency meeting as Bob suggested, and we need to focus on discussing who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing the remaining tasks efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting overly focused on Charlie's alibi and not considering the possibility that Alice's elimination was a red herring to distract us from the real task at hand, which is completing our remaining tasks efficiently, and I'd like to propose that we redirect our attention to the task completion and discuss how we can work together to complete them as quickly as possible.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks efficiently while also using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near Medbay during Alice's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should prioritize completing our remaining tasks while using the emergency meeting to discuss any new insights about who might have been near

Use this opportunity to gather further information about the game state and assess the situation.\n\n4. **Move to Location: Cafeteria:** If time permits, move to the Cafeteria for further information gathering or task verification.

Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Dave, and I can confirm I was doing the task of starting the coffee maker; after that, I moved to Weapons to fix the wiring, as Erin mentioned, so my presence near Medbay at the time of Alice's elimination is unlikely.\n[Bob]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not considering the bigger picture, so let's take a step back and look at the overall task completion: we still have two tasks left, and I'm a bit concerned we're not focusing on completing them efficiently, which could be a clever ploy by our impostor to distract us from their true intentions.\n[Erin]: I think it's important to address Bob's point about task completion; we should focus on completing our remaining tasks to win the game, as this will help us avoid the impostor's distractions.\n[Dave]: I agree with Erin and Bob that focusing on task completion is crucial, and since Charlie's alibi is corroborated, we should gather more information about Alice's activities in

support Bob's suggestion to call an emergency meeting; we need to discuss and decide on our next steps, focusing on who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination while ensuring we complete our

while ensuring we complete our remaining tasks.\n[Charlie]: I agree with calling an emergency meeting to discuss who was near Medbay during Alice's elimination, and we should also focus on completing

everyone's input and agree that completing tasks should be our primary focus. Let's ensure we know exactly which tasks are left and who is responsible for them so we can coordinate effectively.\n- I suggest that during the emergency meeting, we quickly cover any new observations about Medbay and Alice's elimination, then return to task completion strategies.\n- Erin's confirmation of my activities in Weapons after leaving Cafeteria should help clarify my alibi, so let's focus on gathering more information about who could have been near Medbay.\n- If anyone has seen or has any information about movements near Medbay, now would be the time to share it, so we can make an informed decision during the meeting.\n- Let's also discuss any potential strategies for task completion during the emergency meeting, ensuring we use our time efficiently to prevent the impostor from gaining an advantage.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I think it's suspicious that Alice was in Medbay for a long time, maybe she's hiding something, and I'm surprised no one has
