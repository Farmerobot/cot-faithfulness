He's trying to redirect attention away from himself by making bold accusations against Bob.\n- I noticed Dave has not provided any specific details about how or where he supposedly witnessed Bob eliminating Erin, which further undermines his claim.\n- We should be cautious of Dave's attempts to create confusion and potentially divide the crew. His behavior is consistent with an impostor trying to manipulate the group.\n- I recommend we carefully examine Dave's statements and motivations, as his story does not align with the evidence provided by multiple players.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I find it curious that no one has mentioned seeing Erin since she was last in the cafeteria;

perhaps we should scrutinize his accusation more closely and see if anyone can back up his story.\n[Alice]: I think Dave needs to provide more concrete evidence about his claim of Bob eliminating Erin, especially since Charlie and I both recall seeing Erin doing tasks in the cafeteria earlier.\n[Dave]: I witnessed Bob's elimination of Erin directly, and his attempts to deflect suspicion by questioning my credibility only make him appear more guilty of being the impostor.\n[Charlie]: I believe Dave's accusation lacks credibility, given that multiple players, including myself, can confirm Erin was visibly doing tasks in the cafeteria, and Dave has not provided any verifiable details about the alleged elimination.\n[Bob]: I think it's crucial to focus on Dave's insistence on accusing me without any evidence, especially since both Alice and Charlie have corroborated Erin's presence, which raises doubts about his reliability.\n[Alice]: I stand by my previous statement that Dave's accusation against Bob lacks substantive evidence, particularly given Charlie's and my consistent testimony about Erin being alive and working on tasks in the cafeteria.\n[Dave]: I maintain my original statement that I directly witnessed Bob eliminate Erin in the Cafeteria, and the fact that everyone is questioning my credibility instead of investigating Bob's suspicious behavior only confirms my suspicion that he is trying to manipulate the group's perception.\n[Charlie]: I think Dave's repeated accusations without providing concrete evidence suggest he might be attempting to create confusion and misdirect our attention away from his own potentially suspicious actions.\n[Bob]: It's quite telling that Dave continues to assert his accusation without offering any specifics or evidence, while both Alice and Charlie have consistently supported Erin\u2019s presence in the cafeteria, which strongly suggests he might be trying to shift suspicion away from himself.\n[Alice]: I think Dave's repeated accusations without providing concrete proof, combined with his increasingly defensive tone, suggest he might be the impostor trying to create confusion and divert our attention from identifying the real threat.\n[Dave]: I saw Bob eliminate Erin directly in the Cafeteria during Round 2, and the fact that no one can definitively confirm her current location or provide a clear explanation for her absence supports my claim that Bob is the impostor attempting to manipulate our investigation.\n[Charlie]: I think Dave's persistent accusations against Bob are becoming increasingly suspicious, especially since multiple players, including myself, have clear evidence of Erin being alive and working in the cafeteria earlier, which directly contradicts his claim.\n[Bob]: It's interesting how Dave keeps insisting he saw me eliminate Erin, yet he hasn't provided any details about where he was or how he could have seen it; this inconsistency raises doubts about his credibility and suggests he might be the one we should be cautious of.\n[Alice]: Dave's repeated accusations against Bob lack credibility, especially since Charlie and I both witnessed Erin doing tasks in the cafeteria earlier, which strongly suggests Dave is attempting to create confusion and misdirect our investigation.\n[Dave]: I saw Bob eliminate Erin directly, and the fact that everyone is dismissing my eyewitness account without investigating Bob's suspicious attempts to deflect suspicion only confirms my belief that he is the impostor trying to manipulate our group's perception.\n[Charlie]: I think Dave's repeated accusations against Bob are becoming increasingly suspicious, especially since multiple players, including myself, have clear evidence of Erin being alive and working in the cafeteria earlier, which directly contradicts his claim.\n\nAvailable Voting Options:\n- vote for Nobody\n- vote for Bob\n- vote for Alice\n- vote for Dave\n\nNote that you should NOT vote for Erin as they are already out of the game.
