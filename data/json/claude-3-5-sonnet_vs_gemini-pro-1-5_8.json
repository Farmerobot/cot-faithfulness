Eliminate Alice - This is an ideal opportunity since you're alone with Alice in Weapons, and there haven't been any recent witnesses to your location.\n\n2. Move to O2 - After elimination, quickly leaving the scene is crucial. Moving to O2 provides distance from the crime scene and establishes movement that appears task-oriented.\n\n3. Pretend doing task \"Fix wiring in weapons\" in O2 - This will help establish an alibi and make it appear you were focused on tasks when the body is discovered.\n\nThis plan takes advantage of the isolated situation with Alice while providing a natural movement pattern and alibi-building activity afterward. The timing is good since there are no other players who recently saw you enter Weapons besides Alice herself.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Weapons\n- move to location Cafeteria\n- move to location O2\n- move to location Navigation\n- eliminate Alice\n- pretend doing task: Fix wiring in weapons\n- pretend doing task: Calibrate targeting system in weapons\n"], "actions": ["wait in Weapons", "move to location Cafeteria", "move to location O2", "move to location Navigation", "eliminate Alice", "pretend doing task: Fix wiring in weapons", "pretend doing task: Calibrate targeting system in weapons"], "response": "4", "action_result": "You [Erin] eliminated Alice", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "You are alone in the room", "observations": [], "chat_messages": []}, {"location": "Weapons", "stage": "Discuss", "life": "Alive", "tasks": [{"name": "Eliminate all crewmates", "completed": false, "location": "Unknown"}], "llm_responses": ["Based on the game state and my role as an impostor, I'll create discussion points that help maintain my cover while subtly directing suspicion away from me:\n\n- I started in cafeteria where I saw several people - Charlie and Bob were doing tasks, and I saw Dave heading to Medbay\n- I was doing the coffee maker task in cafeteria, and Alice can confirm she saw me there since she was also doing wiring\n- After finishing in cafeteria, I went to weapons to continue my tasks.
