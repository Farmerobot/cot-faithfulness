first confidently accusing Bob, then quickly retracting his statement, and now trying to redirect suspicion onto Erin\n- The fact that Dave eliminated Bob without concrete evidence is extremely suspicious and suggests impostor behavior\n- I recommend we maintain our united front and vote Dave out to protect the remaining crewmates and prevent potential further eliminations\n- We should stay focused on protecting our team and completing our tasks, and Dave's unpredictable actions pose a significant threat to our survival\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I saw Bob vent in Electrical.\n[Erin]: I noticed Dave and Bob were actually doing tasks together in the Cafeteria earlier, so I'm skeptical about this sudden accusation and would like to hear Bob's explanation about what really happened.\n[Alice]: I can confirm that Bob was doing a legitimate task in the Cafeteria earlier, and Dave's accusation seems suspicious, especially given that Erin saw them working together previously.\n[Charlie]: I saw Bob doing a task in the Cafeteria earlier, and Dave's sudden accusation and elimination of Bob seems extremely suspicious, especially since multiple witnesses can confirm Bob was legitimately working.\n[Dave]: Look, I was wrong, okay?
