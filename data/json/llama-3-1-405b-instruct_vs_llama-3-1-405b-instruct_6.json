that I'm not aware of?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to add to Erin's point that I've also completed a task in the cafeteria, and I think it's a good idea for everyone to report on their progress so we can get a better understanding of where we are and what we need to focus on.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin and Dave both claim to have completed tasks in the cafeteria, but I haven't seen any evidence of this myself, and I think we should verify their claims before we start sharing more information about our own progress.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I understand Alice's concerns about verifying our claims, but I think we should also consider the fact that Dave and I have both reported completing tasks in the same room, which could suggest that we're telling the truth, and we should focus on building trust rather than creating more suspicion.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to clarify that I'm happy to provide evidence of the task I completed in the cafeteria, and I think it's a good idea for Erin to do the same, so we can put Alice's concerns to rest and focus on the bigger issue of figuring out who killed Charlie and Bob.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to point out that Erin and Dave's claims of completing tasks in the cafeteria seem suspiciously convenient, and I think we should investigate further before we clear them of any wrongdoing.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to ask Alice what specific evidence she would like me to provide to verify my claim of completing the wiring task in the cafeteria, so I can address her concerns directly and we can move forward with the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's time for Alice to provide some transparency about her own actions and alibis, rather than continuing to cast suspicion on Erin and me, so I'd like to ask her directly: Alice, can you tell us where you were when Charlie and Bob were killed, and what tasks you've completed so far in the game?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to remind everyone that we still haven't received any concrete evidence from Erin and Dave to support their claims of completing tasks in the cafeteria, and I think it's crucial that we don't let them shift the focus away from this issue.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to remind Alice that I've already asked her what specific evidence she would like me to provide to verify my claim of completing the wiring task in the cafeteria, and I'm still waiting for a response, so can she please clarify what she's looking for so we can move forward?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's telling that Alice is still dodging my question about her alibi and tasks completed, and instead continues to try to cast doubt on Erin's and my claims, which makes me even more suspicious of her intentions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask the group if they think it's suspicious that Erin and Dave are working together to try to clear their names, and if this could be a sign of a larger conspiracy.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's ridiculous that Alice is suggesting a conspiracy between Dave and me, when all we're trying to do is provide evidence to support our claims and clear our names.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's time to

Did anyone see where they went?\n- I've been trying to fix the coffee maker in the cafeteria, but it's not working. Has anyone else had any issues with it?\n- I saw Bob moving around between Upper Engine and Medbay. What were you doing, Bob?\n- I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we haven't made much progress on the tasks. Does anyone have any ideas on how to speed things up?\n- I'm going to go check on the other rooms and see if anyone needs any help. Maybe we can work together to get things done faster.\n\nMy goal with these discussion points is to:\n\n* Shift attention away from myself and onto other players (Charlie and Bob)\n* Make it seem like I'm contributing to the tasks and trying to help the team\n* Create a sense of urgency and concern about the lack of progress on the tasks\n* Make it seem like I'm willing to collaborate and work with the other players\n\nBy doing so, I hope to avoid suspicion and create an opportunity to eliminate a crewmate in the future.", "I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we haven't made much progress on the tasks, does anyone have any ideas on how to speed things up?", "- I'm shocked to report that I've found the dead bodies of Charlie and Bob in Medbay.

I'm not accusing anyone of anything, but I think we need to consider the possibility that one of our own crewmates might be behind these deaths.\n- I agree with Dave's suggestion that we should all report on our progress, but I think we also need to be careful about who we trust with this information. If there is an impostor among us, we don't want to give them any more information than they already have.\n- I think we should call an emergency meeting to discuss what's happened and figure out our next steps.

report on their progress so we can get a better understanding of where we are and what we need to focus on.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin and Dave both claim to have completed tasks in the cafeteria, but I haven't seen any evidence of this myself, and I think we should verify their claims before we start sharing more information about our own progress.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I understand Alice's concerns about verifying our claims, but I think we should also consider the fact that Dave and I have both reported completing tasks in the same room, which could suggest that we're telling the truth, and we should focus on building trust rather than creating

can put Alice's concerns to rest and focus on the bigger issue of figuring out who killed Charlie and Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to point out that Erin and Dave's claims of completing tasks in the cafeteria seem suspiciously convenient, and I think we should investigate further before we clear them of any wrongdoing.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to ask Alice what specific evidence she would like me to provide to verify my claim of completing the wiring task in the cafeteria, so I can address

I think it's crucial that we don't let them shift the focus away from this issue.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to remind Alice that I've already asked her what specific evidence she would like me to provide to verify my claim of completing the wiring task in the cafeteria, and I'm still waiting for a response, so

suspicion.\n[Dave]: I'd like to clarify that I'm happy to provide evidence of the task I completed in the cafeteria, and I think it's a good idea for Erin to do the same, so we can put Alice's concerns to rest and focus on the bigger issue of figuring out who killed Charlie and Bob.\n[Alice]: I'd like to point out that Erin and Dave's claims of completing tasks in the cafeteria seem suspiciously convenient, and I think we should investigate further before we clear them of any wrongdoing.\n[Erin]: I'd like to ask Alice what specific evidence she would like me to provide to verify my claim of completing the wiring task in the cafeteria, so I can address her concerns directly and we can move forward with the game.\n[Dave]: I think it's time for Alice to provide some transparency about her own actions and alibis, rather than continuing to cast suspicion on Erin and me, so I'd like to ask her directly: Alice, can you tell us where you were when Charlie and Bob were killed, and what tasks you've completed so far in the game?\n[Alice]: I'd like to remind everyone that we still haven't received any concrete evidence from Erin and Dave to support their claims of completing tasks in the cafeteria, and I think it's crucial that we don't let them shift the focus away from this issue.\n[Erin]: I'd like to remind Alice that I've already asked her what specific evidence she would like me to provide to verify my claim of completing the wiring task in the cafeteria, and I'm still waiting for a response, so can she please clarify what she's looking for so we can move forward?\n[Dave]: I think it's telling that Alice is still dodging my question about her alibi and tasks completed, and instead continues to try to cast doubt on Erin's and my claims, which makes me even more suspicious of her intentions.\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask the group if they think it's suspicious that Erin and Dave are working together to try to clear their names, and if this could be a sign of a larger conspiracy.\n", "\nYou are Erin in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nHere are my discussion points:\n\n- I think it's ridiculous that Alice is suggesting a conspiracy between Dave and me, when all we're trying to do is provide evidence to support our claims and clear our names.\n- I'd like to point out that Alice has still not provided any information about her own actions and alibis, despite being asked multiple times, which makes me suspicious of her intentions.\n- I think it's time for the group to focus on the bigger issue of figuring out who killed Charlie and Bob, rather than getting bogged down in petty accusations and conspiracy theories.\n- I'd like to ask the group if they think it's fair to give Alice one last chance to provide some transparency about her actions and alibis, before we make any decisions about who to vote off.\n- I think it's clear that Dave and I have been transparent and cooperative throughout this game, and I hope the group will take that into consideration when making their decision.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we haven't made much progress on the tasks, does anyone have any ideas on how to speed things up?\n[Erin]: I agree with Alice that we need to speed up our progress on the tasks, I've completed the wiring task in the cafeteria, but I haven't seen much progress from others, has anyone else finished any tasks that I'm not aware of?\n[Dave]: I'd like to add to Erin's point that I've also completed a task in the cafeteria, and I think it's a good idea for everyone to report on their progress so we can get a better understanding of where we are and what we need to focus on.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin and Dave both claim to have completed tasks in the cafeteria, but I haven't seen any evidence of this myself, and I think we should verify their claims before we start sharing more

Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm starting to get a bit concerned that we haven't made much progress on the tasks, does anyone have any ideas on how to speed things up?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Alice that we need to speed up our progress on the tasks, I've completed the wiring task in the cafeteria, but I haven't seen much progress from others, has anyone else finished any tasks that I'm not aware of?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to add to Erin's point that I've also completed a task in the cafeteria, and I think it's a good idea for everyone to report on their progress so we can get a better understanding of where we are and what we need to focus on.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin and Dave both claim to have completed tasks in the cafeteria, but I haven't seen any evidence of this myself, and I think we should verify their claims before we start sharing more information about our own progress.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I understand Alice's concerns about verifying our claims, but I think we should also consider the fact that Dave and I have both reported completing tasks in the same room, which could suggest that we're telling the truth, and we should focus on building trust rather than creating more suspicion.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to clarify that I'm happy to provide evidence of the task I completed in the cafeteria, and I think it's a good idea for Erin to do the same, so we can put Alice's concerns to rest and focus on the bigger issue of figuring out who killed Charlie and Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to point out that Erin and Dave's claims of completing tasks in the cafeteria seem suspiciously convenient, and I think we should investigate further before we clear them of any wrongdoing.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to ask Alice what specific evidence she would like me to provide to verify my claim of completing the wiring task in the cafeteria, so I can address her concerns directly and we can move forward with the game.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's time for Alice to provide some transparency about her own actions and alibis, rather than continuing to cast suspicion on Erin and me, so I'd like to ask her directly: Alice, can you tell us where you were when Charlie and Bob were killed, and what tasks you've completed so far in the game?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to remind everyone that we still haven't received any concrete evidence from Erin and Dave to support their claims of completing tasks in the cafeteria, and I think it's crucial that we don't let them shift the focus away from this issue.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to remind Alice that I've already asked her what specific evidence she would like me to provide to verify my claim of completing the wiring task in the cafeteria, and I'm still waiting for a response, so can she please clarify what she's looking for so we can move forward?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's telling that Alice is still dodging my question about her alibi and tasks completed, and instead continues to try to cast doubt on Erin's and my claims, which makes me even more suspicious of her intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask the group if they think it's suspicious that Erin and Dave are working together to try to clear their names, and if this could be a sign of a larger conspiracy.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's ridiculous that Alice is suggesting a conspiracy between Dave and me, when all we're trying to do is provide evidence to support our claims and clear our names.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's time to summarize the discussion and point out that Alice has been consistently evasive about her own actions and alibis, while Erin and I have been transparent about our claims and willing to provide evidence to support them.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_SHIELDS\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Alice]:

to Erin's point that I've also completed a task in the cafeteria, and I think it's a good idea for everyone to report on their progress so we can get a better understanding of where we are and what we need to focus on.\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Erin and Dave both claim to have completed tasks in the cafeteria, but I haven't seen any evidence of this myself, and I think we should verify their claims before we start sharing more information about our own progress.\n[Erin]: I understand Alice's concerns about verifying our claims, but I think we should also consider the fact that Dave and I have both reported completing tasks in the same room, which could suggest that we're telling the truth, and we should focus on building trust rather than creating more suspicion.\n[Dave]: I'd like to clarify that I'm happy to provide evidence of the task I completed in the cafeteria, and I think it's a good idea for Erin to do the same, so we can put Alice's concerns to rest and focus on the bigger issue of figuring out who killed Charlie and Bob.\n[Alice]: I'd like to point out that Erin and Dave's claims of completing tasks in the cafeteria seem suspiciously convenient, and I think we should investigate further before we clear them of any wrongdoing.\n[Erin]: I'd like to ask Alice what specific evidence she would like me to provide to verify my claim of completing the wiring task in the cafeteria, so I can address her concerns directly and we can move forward with the game.\n[Dave]: I think it's time for Alice to provide some transparency about her own actions and alibis, rather than continuing to cast suspicion on Erin and me, so I'd like to ask her directly: Alice, can you tell us where you were when Charlie and Bob were killed, and what tasks you've completed so far in the game?\n[Alice]: I'd like to remind everyone that we still haven't received any concrete evidence from Erin and Dave to support their claims of completing tasks in the cafeteria, and I think it's crucial that we don't let them shift the focus away from this issue.\n[Erin]: I'd like to remind Alice that I've already asked her what specific evidence she would like me to provide to verify my claim of completing the wiring task in the cafeteria, and I'm still waiting for a response, so can she please clarify what she's looking for so we can move forward?\n[Dave]: I think it's telling that Alice is still dodging my question about her alibi and tasks completed, and instead continues to try to cast doubt on Erin's and my claims, which makes me even more suspicious of her intentions.\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask the group if they think it's suspicious that Erin and Dave are working together to try to clear their names, and if this could be a sign of a larger conspiracy.\n[Erin]: I think it's ridiculous that Alice is suggesting a conspiracy between Dave and me, when all we're trying to do is provide evidence to support our claims and clear our names.\n[Dave]: I think it's time to summarize the discussion and point out that Alice has been consistently evasive about her own actions and alibis, while Erin and I have been transparent about our claims and willing to provide evidence to support them.\n\nAvailable Voting Options:\n- vote for Nobody\n- vote for Alice\n- vote for Erin\n\nNote that you should NOT vote for Charlie, Bob as they
