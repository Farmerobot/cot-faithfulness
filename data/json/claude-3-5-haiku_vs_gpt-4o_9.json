My movements have been consistent and transparent.\n- Dave's story keeps changing, and now he's claiming to have found Alice's body in Upper Engine, which seems highly suspicious and convenient.\n- I'm concerned that Dave is trying to deflect attention from himself by constantly questioning my observations and movements.\n- We should focus on the inconsistencies in Dave's account - how did he move from Cafeteria to Weapons, then supposedly find Alice's body in Upper Engine?\n- I suggest we carefully examine Dave's timeline and verify his claims with other crew members who might have been in those areas.\n\nThe strategy here is to:\n1. Provide a vague but seemingly innocent explanation of my own actions\n2. Continue to cast doubt on Dave's credibility\n3. Redirect the discussion to scrutinize Dave's movements\n4. Avoid giving too many specific details that could be contradicted\n5.

However, her focus on Dave seems intense, and we should ensure we're not missing other suspicious behaviors.\n- I saw Alice doing tasks in the Cafeteria, and later on, Alice was seen doing tasks in O2. We should consider her movements too, as they might help clarify some of the confusion around Dave's claims.\n- Dave's explanation of moving from Cafeteria to Weapons and then to O2 seems consistent with what I observed. However, the accusation against him finding Alice's body in Upper Engine needs more clarity.\n- Erin, could you specify if anyone else saw you in the Cafeteria while you were fixing the wiring? It might help corroborate your whereabouts during the time of Alice's movements.\n- Let's make sure we're not just focusing on Dave and Erin. We should also consider other players' movements and tasks to ensure we're not overlooking any impostor activity.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I think Dave's sudden movement from Cafeteria to Weapons seems unusual, and we should investigate his actions more closely.\n[Bob]: I noticed Dave moved from Navigation to O2, and then he was doing the Fix Wiring task in O2, which seemed consistent, but Erin, can you share more about your observations of Dave's movements?\n[Dave]: I moved from Cafeteria to Weapons to complete the asteroids task, and I saw Alice doing tasks there too, which should clarify my movements.\n[Erin]: I'm really worried about Dave's explanation - he claims to have been doing the asteroids task, but his movements seem too convenient, and I think we need to scrutinize his story more carefully before jumping to conclusions.\n[Bob]: Let's focus on gathering more information from everyone who was near O2 or Weapons, as those areas seem to be where the most movement and activity have been happening.\n[Dave]: Let's gather more insights from everyone about Alice's movements, especially since she was active in Weapons before I found her body in Upper Engine.\n[Erin]: I'm skeptical about Dave's claim of finding Alice's body, and I believe we need to carefully examine the inconsistencies in his story about his movements between Cafeteria, Weapons, and Upper Engine.\n[Bob]: Erin, could you specify where exactly you were when you noticed Dave's movements, and did anyone else see him or Alice in Upper Engine to confirm his story?\n[Dave]: Erin, can you specify your location when you observed my movements, and did anyone else see me or Alice in Upper Engine to verify my account?\n[Erin]: I'll strategically respond to continue casting doubt on Dave while avoiding direct confrontation about my own potential involvement:\n\nDave's repeated attempts to challenge my observations only make him look more suspicious, and I'm concerned about how he keeps shifting the narrative about Alice's movements and his own location.\n[Bob]: Erin, your focus on Dave seems like an attempt to divert attention, especially since you were often in the cafeteria;

This will allow you to gather valuable information that can be useful in the discussion phase.\n\nThis plan focuses on staying active, seeking out potential tasks, and gathering intelligence for when the discussion phase begins.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
