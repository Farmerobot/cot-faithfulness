it seemed like everyone was focused on tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in the Cafeteria and saw Alice emptying the trash, so I can confirm her alibi, but we should consider if anyone not in the Cafeteria could be suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in the Cafeteria with Alice, Charlie, Erin, and Bob, and we all seemed to be focused on completing tasks; it might be useful to hear from anyone who wasn't there\u2014where were you, and what were you doing?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave's right, we need to know everyone's location, especially Green's, since they haven't spoken up yet about where they were.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: It's important to hear from Green about their location and actions during the time we were all in the cafeteria to help us identify any suspicious activity.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: We really need Green to share their location and actions during the time we were all in the Cafeteria, as their silence is concerning.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Dave: Since Green hasn't responded yet, it's crucial for them to explain their whereabouts and actions during the time of the incident to clear any suspicions.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Green's silence is definitely concerning, and for the sake of the group, we need to consider the possibility of sabotage if they don't speak up soon.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: If Green continues to remain silent, we should seriously consider them as a suspect for the next vote, given their lack of response and absence from the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's make sure everyone shares their remaining tasks so we can strategize completing them efficiently while we wait for Green to explain their actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Bob; sharing our remaining tasks will help organize our efforts and ensure we complete them efficiently, so let's list them out while we wait for Green to respond.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: My remaining tasks are download data and swipe card, both in admin, so I'll be heading there now if
