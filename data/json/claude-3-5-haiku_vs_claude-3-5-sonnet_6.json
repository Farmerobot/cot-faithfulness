After that, no one has seen Alice, while Dave and Bob have been consistently visible and verifiable.\n\n- Dave has been able to verify my movements and tasks throughout the game, and I can do the same for him - we've crossed paths multiple times in Weapons, O2, and Shields where I saw him completing specific tasks.\n\n- The fact that three of us (myself, Bob, and Dave) can all verify each other's locations and tasks, while Alice has been completely unaccounted for since Charlie's death, is extremely suspicious.\n\n- We need to act decisively now - we have enough evidence against Alice with Charlie's body discovery location matching her last known position, her complete absence since then, and three witnesses who can verify each other but not her.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I was doing wiring tasks in the Cafeteria and then moved to Medbay to run diagnostics, which Alice can confirm - has anyone else completed their Medbay tasks yet?\n[Dave]: I can vouch for Bob doing wiring

suspicious since none of us have seen them since the coffee maker incident in Cafeteria, and I can confirm seeing Bob and Dave consistently doing their claimed tasks.\n[Bob]: I'm deeply concerned about Charlie's sudden death and believe we need to methodically review everyone's movements to understand what happened without jumping to hasty conclusions.\n[Dave]: Given that I've seen Erin completing multiple verifiable tasks while Alice has been mysteriously absent since Charlie was last seen alive, I think we need to seriously question Alice's whereabouts during this time period.\n[Erin]: I need to report that I just discovered Charlie's body in the Cafeteria, and given that Alice has been unaccounted for since leaving there early on, this seems extremely suspicious.\n[Bob]: I'm shocked about Charlie's death and agree we need to carefully investigate Alice's movements, but we should also remain calm and gather more concrete evidence before making any definitive accusations.\n[Dave]: Since I've been tracking everyone's movements closely and can verify both Bob and Erin's activities, while Alice has been suspiciously absent since Charlie was last
