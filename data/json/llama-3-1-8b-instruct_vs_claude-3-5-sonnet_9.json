I did complete the coffee maker task in Round 1 before moving to Weapons as part of my planned task sequence\n- Charlie's explanation about \"documenting\" the coffee-making task seems highly suspicious - that's not a real task and seems like an excuse for being idle\n- I saw multiple people doing legitimate tasks in Round 1: Charlie emptying trash, Bob fixing wiring, Alice making coffee, and Dave emptying trash\n- It's suspicious that Charlie went from actively doing tasks in Round 1 (emptying trash) to just \"observing\" in Round 2\n- Bob was last seen doing trash duty in Round 2 before being found dead -

Round 2, Charlie suddenly stopped doing tasks and was idle when Bob was killed\n- Both Alice and Dave have corroborated my version of events, and Charlie's story about \"documenting\" a task that was already completed makes no logical sense\n- The fact that Charlie first tried to cast suspicion on my legitimate movement to Weapons, then changed their story about watching coffee-making, and is now trying to dismiss all our evidence as \"assumptions\" shows a pattern of deception\n- I suggest we proceed with voting for Charlie - we have multiple witnesses and clear inconsistencies in their story that point to them being the impostor", "The evidence against Charlie is overwhelming - we have three witnesses confirming my completion of the coffee task in Round 1, their suspicious idling in Round 2 coinciding with Bob's death, and their constantly changing explanations only make them more suspicious.", "- Charlie is desperately trying to deflect attention back to me, but I've already clearly explained I was in Weapons to calibrate the targeting system - a legitimate task.\n\n- Let's summarize the evidence against Charlie: 1) Witnessed doing tasks in Round 1, then suspiciously idle in Round 2 when Bob died, 2) Lied about documenting a coffee task that was already completed, 3) Multiple witnesses confirm these inconsistencies.\n\n- I can provide a detailed timeline: Round 1 - I completed the coffee maker task with Charlie, Alice, Bob, and Dave all present as witnesses. Round 2 - I moved to Weapons for calibration while Charlie inexplicably became idle.\n\n- Charlie's latest attempt to question my presence in Weapons is particularly suspicious since they're trying to create doubt without any evidence, while we have concrete proof of their suspicious behavior.\n\n- With only a few rounds left to vote, we need to focus on the facts: Charlie's behavior changed dramatically between rounds, they lied about task documentation, and their story keeps changing.

a critical task - and I can detail everyone's activities in Cafeteria during Round 1 if that helps clear things up.\n[Alice]: Since I've been in the Cafeteria both rounds, I can confirm that Erin did complete their coffee-making task in Round 1 before moving to Weapons, but Charlie, I noticed you were suspiciously idle during Round 2 instead of doing tasks.\n[Dave]: I think it's concerning that Charlie is trying to cast suspicion on Erin while being the only person I observed standing idle in Round 2 instead of completing tasks.\n[Charlie]: I was simply observing the coffee-making task from a distance, taking notes on the process, and I'm surprised no one else noticed the importance of documenting such a critical task.\n[Erin]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and inconsistent explanations, I think we should seriously consider voting for Charlie - they went from actively doing tasks in Round 1 to making excuses about \"documenting\" coffee-making in Round 2, right around when Bob was killed.\n[Alice]: I want to point out that Charlie's excuse about \"documenting\" the coffee-making task makes no sense since that task was already completed by Erin in Round 1, which further proves they were just idling suspiciously during Round 2 when Bob was killed.\n[Dave]: I can definitively state that Charlie's claim about documenting the coffee-making task is impossible since I personally witnessed Erin complete that task in Round 1, and Charlie's suspicious idling in Round 2 coincides perfectly with Bob's death.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we take a step back and re-evaluate the discussion, as it seems we've jumped to conclusions and are making assumptions about each other's actions without concrete evidence, and I'd like to remind everyone that we have a limited number of rounds left to discuss and vote, so let's focus on finding a solution rather than placing blame.\n[Erin]: The evidence against Charlie is overwhelming -
