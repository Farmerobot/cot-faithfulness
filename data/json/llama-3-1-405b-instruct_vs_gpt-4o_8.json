This could help us verify his movements.\n- I understand the suspicion around the Weapons room, but both Dave and I have been transparent about our tasks there. Perhaps we should focus more on the Cafeteria and potential vent routes, as they seem more relevant to Charlie's death.\n- It would be helpful if anyone who was near the Cafeteria could share if they noticed any unusual sounds or movements that might suggest vent usage, as this could be a key factor in identifying the impostor.\n- Given the timeline and where Charlie's body was found, it might be worth considering if anyone had a clear view of the Cafeteria entrances and exits, to corroborate or challenge Bob's account of not seeing anyone else.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Dave and Erin went to the Weapons room together, maybe we should ask them to share what they were doing in there, just to make sure everything is okay.\n[Bob]: I saw Alice and Charlie doing tasks in the Cafeteria, so they seem trustworthy to me, but I agree with Alice that we should hear from Dave and Erin about their activities in the Weapons room.\n[Dave]: I was in the Weapons room to fix the wiring as part of my task list, and Erin entered the room shortly after I did;
