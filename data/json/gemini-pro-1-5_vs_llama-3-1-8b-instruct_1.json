By moving to Medbay, Bob can try to gather more information and piece together what happened.\n2. **Ask Charlie about his alibi**: Once in Medbay, Bob should ask Charlie to confirm his whereabouts during the time Alice was eliminated and ask him to provide more information about his alibi. This will help Bob assess Charlie's credibility and potential involvement in Alice's elimination.\n3. **Examine Charlie's behavior and body language**: Bob should pay close attention to Charlie's behavior and body language, as he has been acting suspiciously nervous and evasive throughout the game. If there are any inconsistencies in his statements or body language, it could indicate his potential involvement in Alice's elimination.\n4. **Gather more information and evidence**: Bob should continue to ask questions and gather more information about the events surrounding Alice's elimination, including what happened between the time she was alive and the time she was eliminated. He should also look for any evidence or witnesses that can corroborate the events.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
