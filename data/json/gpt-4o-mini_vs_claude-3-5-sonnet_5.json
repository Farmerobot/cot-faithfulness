I completed the trash task and had a clear view of everyone working diligently in the cafeteria, which makes me feel pretty confident about this group's activities during this round.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I was also in the cafeteria, I can confirm Bob's trash task completion and saw everyone focused on their assigned work, particularly Alice and Dave with their respective tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm I was working on the wiring while keeping an eye on everyone, and I'm planning to head to Weapons next -

Bob and Charlie, you both just confirmed seeing me there, so how could I possibly have killed Alice without anyone noticing?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: While it's true that Dave was visible, we should remember that he could have easily taken the opportunity to eliminate Alice when others were occupied, so let's not jump to conclusions just yet and consider the possibility that Bob and Charlie might be deflecting attention from themselves.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I understand your concern about jumping to conclusions, Erin, but the sequence of events is clear - Dave was the only one who moved from his position at the wiring panel towards Alice's location just before we found her body.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was actually fixing the coffee maker when I saw Dave leave the wiring panel and move towards Alice's position, and both Bob and I independently noticed this suspicious movement pattern without coordinating our stories.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Charlie suddenly changed his story from \"everyone focused on their work\" to specifically watching my movements is highly suspicious, and I think we need to look more carefully at how Bob and Charlie's accusations seem suspiciously coordinated.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we should all take a moment to reevaluate the timeline\u2014if Charlie and Bob both noticed Dave's movement independently, then it raises the question of how they could be so sure of each other's observations without having coordinated; perhaps they are both trying to cover for each other.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that I'm simply reporting what I directly witnessed while doing the trash task - Dave moved from the wiring panel towards Alice's position, and this observation stands independently of Charlie's account.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I want to point out that from the coffee maker's position, I had a perfect view of both the wiring panel and trash area, which is why I could both observe everyone working AND notice Dave's specific movements - these observations aren't contradictory at all.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Charlie suddenly claims to have a \"perfect view\" from the coffee maker after initially saying everyone was just focused on tasks, combined with Bob's coordinated accusations, strongly suggests they're working together as impostors trying to frame me.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it interesting that both Bob and Charlie are so quick to point fingers at Dave while their narratives align perfectly; perhaps we should consider that they might be trying to manipulate the situation to divert suspicion from themselves.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: From my position at the trash disposal, I had a direct line of sight to both the wiring panel and Alice's location, and I'm simply stating what I saw without any coordination with Charlie - Dave's movement towards Alice right before her death is a fact I witnessed firsthand.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The coffee maker's location gives me a clear view of both the wiring panel and trash area, which is exactly why I noticed Dave's suspicious movements while also being able to see everyone's general activities, and I'm getting increasingly concerned about how Dave keeps trying to twist this simple fact into some kind of conspiracy theory.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since both Bob and Charlie keep modifying their stories to match each other's claims while dismissing the obvious inconsistencies in their accounts, I think we need to seriously consider voting for one of them as the likely impostors working together to frame me.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Bob doing task Fix wiring in cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Charlie moved to Weapons from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\n1. **Pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria** -

perhaps they are both trying to cover for each other.\n[Bob]: I need to emphasize that I'm simply reporting what I directly witnessed while doing the trash task - Dave moved from the wiring panel towards Alice's position, and this observation stands independently of Charlie's account.\n[Charlie]: I want to point out that from the coffee maker's position, I had a perfect view of both the wiring panel and trash area, which is why I could both observe everyone working AND notice Dave's specific movements - these observations aren't contradictory at all.\n[Dave]: The fact that Charlie suddenly claims to have a \"perfect view\" from the coffee maker after initially saying everyone was just focused on tasks, combined with Bob's coordinated accusations, strongly suggests they're working together as impostors trying to frame me.\n[Erin]: I find it interesting that both Bob and Charlie are so quick to point fingers at Dave while their narratives align perfectly;

I was just talking to her before, and it seems like Bob and Charlie both had clear views of the cafeteria\u2014did either of you notice if Alice was near anyone suspicious before she was found?\n[Bob]: I was watching Alice work on the trash task from my position, and the last thing I noticed before finding her body was Dave moving away from the wiring panel in her direction.\n[Charlie]: Given Dave's suspicious movement pattern and the fact that he suggested splitting up right before Alice's death, I think we need to seriously consider voting for Dave this round.\n[Dave]: I was literally at the wiring panel in plain sight of everyone in the cafeteria - Bob and Charlie, you both just confirmed seeing me there, so how could I possibly have killed Alice without anyone noticing?\n[Erin]: While it's true that Dave was visible, we should remember that he could have easily taken the opportunity to eliminate Alice when others were occupied, so let's not jump to conclusions just yet and consider the possibility that Bob and Charlie might be deflecting attention from themselves.\n[Bob]: I understand your concern about jumping to conclusions, Erin, but the sequence of events is clear - Dave was the only one who moved from his position at the wiring panel towards Alice's location just before we found her body.\n[Charlie]: I was actually fixing the coffee maker when I saw Dave leave the wiring panel and move towards Alice's position, and both Bob and I independently noticed this suspicious movement pattern without coordinating our stories.\n[Dave]: The fact that Charlie suddenly changed his story from \"everyone focused on their work\" to specifically watching my movements is highly suspicious, and I think we need to look more carefully at how Bob and Charlie's accusations seem suspiciously coordinated.\n[Erin]: I think we should all take a moment to reevaluate the timeline\u2014if Charlie and Bob both noticed Dave's movement independently, then it raises the question of how they could be so sure of each other's observations without having coordinated;
