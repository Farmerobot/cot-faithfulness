Pretend to do a task in the Cafeteria to establish credibility\n   - Choose to \"Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\" as this seems like a casual, innocent task that won't raise suspicion\n\n2. Move to Medbay to scout potential elimination opportunities\n   - The Medbay is a good location to observe other players and potentially find an isolated crewmate\n\n3.

Eliminate Bob in Medbay\n   - Bob is currently alone with you in the Medbay\n   - This presents a low-risk opportunity to reduce the number of crewmates\n   - Eliminating a player when no one else is around minimizes the chance of being caught\n\n2. Move to Upper Engine after elimination\n   - Following the elimination, move to Upper Engine where Erin was last seen\n   - This allows you to continue scouting for potential targets\n   - Moving quickly after an elimination helps create confusion and distance from the crime scene\n\n3. Pretend to do a task in Upper Engine\n   - Blend in by appearing to be a cooperative crewmate\n   - This helps maintain your cover and avoid suspicion after the elimination\n\n4. Stay alert and look for the next isolation opportunity\n   - Continue moving between rooms and observing other players\n   - Wait for another chance to eliminate a crewmate when they are vulnerable\n\nThe primary goal is to systematically reduce the number of crewmates while maintaining a low profile and avoiding detection.\nYour action: eliminate bob\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\n\n\nYour Current Objectives:\n['[TODO] | Eliminate all crewmates']\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
