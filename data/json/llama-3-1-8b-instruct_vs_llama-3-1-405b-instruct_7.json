[Dave]: I agree with Charlie's suggestion to review the security footage, it's always better to be safe than sorry, and it might give us some valuable information about potential impostors.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add to Charlie's and Dave's suggestion to review the security footage by proposing that we also share our individual task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a clearer picture of who was where and when.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to echo Bob's suggestion and encourage everyone to share their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, and I'll start by sharing my own: after completing the cafeteria trash task in Round 1, I moved to Admin and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but I haven't seen Alice since she

her more questions about her whereabouts and task progress.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's crucial that Erin clarifies her statement about seeing me and Bob working on tasks in Admin, specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide more details about her whereabouts and task progress between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now, as her delayed report raises some suspicions in my mind.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I

impostor.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_UPPER_ENGINE\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Charlie]: I think it's a great idea to discuss task progress, but I'm also concerned that we might be overlooking some potential security risks, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual.\n[Dave]: I agree with Charlie's suggestion to review the security footage, it's always better to be safe than sorry, and it might give us some valuable information about potential impostors.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add to Charlie's and Dave's suggestion to review the security footage by proposing that we also share our individual task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a clearer picture of who was where and when.\n[Erin]: I'd like to echo Bob's suggestion and encourage everyone to share their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, and I'll start by sharing my own: after completing the cafeteria trash task in Round 1, I moved to Admin and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but I haven't seen Alice since she moved to Medbay in Round 2, which is getting a bit concerning.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, and I think Erin's account of not seeing Alice since she moved to Medbay is suspicious, and I'd like to ask her more questions about her whereabouts and task progress.\n[Dave]: I think it's crucial that Erin clarifies her statement about seeing me and Bob working on tasks in Admin, specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\n[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide more details about her whereabouts and task progress between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now, as her delayed report raises some suspicions in my mind.\n[Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I thought she might have been working on a task in Medbay, and I didn't want to jump to conclusions, and I'd also like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to share their own task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we put Erin's request for us to share our task progress and whereabouts on hold for now, and instead focus on reviewing the security footage from the previous night, as I believe it's crucial that we get a more complete picture of what's been happening before we make any further decisions.\n[Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous concerns about Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and ask her to provide a more detailed timeline of her actions between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\n[Bob]: I think it's crucial that we hear from Charlie and Dave about their specific reasons for prioritizing the security footage review over sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, and what specific information they hope to gain from it, before we proceed with Charlie's proposal to put Erin's request on hold.\n[Erin]: I'd like to emphasize that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening and make more informed decisions about who to trust.\n[Charlie]: I think it's time for us to focus on concrete evidence and tangible leads, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual, rather than relying solely on Erin's account of her whereabouts and task progress, which I believe may be subject to interpretation and potential manipulation.\n[Dave]: I'd like to address Charlie's last point and clarify that reviewing the security footage is not a replacement for sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, but rather a complementary step in our investigation.\n[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate Erin's point that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\n[Erin]: I'd like to reiterate my previous proposal to create a timeline of events and task progress to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I'd like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to provide their specific contributions to this timeline, including their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\n[Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and her lack of concrete evidence to support her claims, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, given the mounting concerns about her reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\n[Dave]: I think it's time for us to summarize our findings and create a timeline of events, as Erin suggested, to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I propose that we hold off on voting until we have a more complete picture of what's been happening.\n[Bob]: I think we should focus on creating the timeline of events and task progress, as Erin and Dave suggested, to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I'd like to ask Charlie to clarify his proposal to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, specifically what evidence he has to support his claims about Erin's reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\n[Erin]: I'd like to reiterate my proposal to create a timeline of events and task progress, and I'd like to specifically ask Charlie to clarify what concrete evidence he has to support his claims about my reliability and potential involvement as an impostor, as I believe it's essential to focus on tangible leads rather than making unsubstantiated accusations.\n[Charlie]: I think it's

detailed timeline of her actions between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\n[Dave]: I'd like to summarize the key points from our discussion so far and create a preliminary timeline of events, including Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence, Charlie's proposal to review the security footage, and Bob's suggestion to share individual task progress and whereabouts, to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies.\n[Bob]: I'd like to ask Charlie to clarify what concrete evidence he has to support his claims about Erin's reliability and potential involvement as an impostor, as I believe it's essential to focus on tangible leads rather than making

didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\n[Dave]: I'd like to interrupt the discussion and report that I found Erin's dead body in the Upper Engine, which raises significant concerns about the presence of an impostor among us, and I think it's crucial that we re-examine our previous discussions and timelines to identify any potential clues or discrepancies that may have been overlooked.\n[Bob]: I'd like to acknowledge Dave's report of finding Erin's dead body in the Upper Engine, which is a significant development in our investigation, and I think it's crucial that

specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide more details about her whereabouts and task progress between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now, as her delayed report raises some suspicions in my mind.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I

idea to discuss task progress, but I'm also concerned that we might be overlooking some potential security risks, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual.\n[Dave]: I agree with Charlie's suggestion to review the security footage, it's always better to be safe than sorry, and it might give us some valuable information about potential impostors.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add to Charlie's and Dave's suggestion to review the security footage by proposing that we also share our individual task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a clearer picture of who was where and when.\n[Erin]: I'd like to echo Bob's suggestion and encourage everyone to share their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, and I'll start by sharing my own: after completing the cafeteria trash task in Round 1, I moved to Admin and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but I haven't seen Alice since she moved to Medbay in Round 2, which is getting a bit concerning.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, and I think Erin's account of not seeing Alice since she moved to Medbay is suspicious, and I'd like to ask her more questions about her whereabouts and task progress.\n[Dave]: I think it's crucial that Erin clarifies her statement about seeing me and Bob working on tasks in Admin, specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\n[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide more details about her whereabouts and task progress between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now, as her delayed report raises some suspicions in my mind.\n[Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I thought she might have been working on a task in Medbay, and I didn't want to jump to conclusions, and I'd also like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to share their own task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we put Erin's request for us to share our task progress and whereabouts on hold for now, and instead focus on reviewing the security footage from the previous night, as I believe it's crucial that we get a more complete picture of what's been happening before we make any further decisions.\n[Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous concerns about Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and ask her to provide a more detailed timeline of her actions between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\n[Bob]: I think it's crucial that we hear from Charlie and Dave about their specific reasons for prioritizing the security footage review over sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, and what specific information they hope to gain from it, before we proceed with Charlie's proposal to put Erin's request on hold.\n[Erin]: I'd like to emphasize that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening and make more informed decisions about who to trust.\n[Charlie]: I think it's time for us to focus on concrete evidence and tangible leads, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual, rather than relying solely on Erin's account of her whereabouts and task progress, which I believe may be subject to interpretation and potential manipulation.\n[Dave]: I'd like to address Charlie's last point and clarify that reviewing the security footage is not a replacement for sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, but rather a

including their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\n[Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and her lack of concrete evidence to support her claims, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, given the mounting concerns about her reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\n[Dave]: I think it's time for us to summarize our findings and create a timeline of events,

happening.\n[Bob]: I think we should focus on creating the timeline of events and task progress, as Erin and Dave suggested, to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential

whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a clearer picture of who was where and when.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to echo Bob's suggestion and encourage everyone to share their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, and I'll start by sharing my own: after completing the cafeteria trash task in Round 1, I moved to Admin and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but I

working on tasks in Admin, specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide more details about her whereabouts and task progress between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now, as her delayed report raises some suspicions in my mind.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about

the security footage by proposing that we also share our individual task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a clearer picture of who was where and when.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to echo Bob's suggestion and encourage everyone to share their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, and I'll start by sharing my own: after completing the cafeteria trash task in Round 1, I moved to Admin and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but I haven't seen Alice since she moved to Medbay in Round 2, which is getting a bit concerning.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, and I think Erin's account of not seeing Alice since she moved to

Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I thought she might have been working on a task in Medbay, and I didn't want to jump to

happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we put Erin's request for us to share our task progress and whereabouts on hold for now, and instead focus on reviewing the security

it's crucial that we hear from Charlie and Dave about their specific reasons for prioritizing the security footage review over sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, and what specific information they hope to gain from it, before we proceed with Charlie's proposal to put Erin's request on hold.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to emphasize that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening and make more informed

point that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture

concerned that we might be overlooking some potential security risks, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual.\n[Dave]: I agree with Charlie's suggestion to review the security footage, it's always better to be safe than sorry, and it might give us some valuable information about potential impostors.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add to Charlie's and Dave's suggestion to review the security footage by proposing that we also share our individual task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a clearer picture of who was where and when.\n[Erin]: I'd like to echo Bob's suggestion and encourage everyone to share their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, and I'll start by sharing my own: after completing the cafeteria trash task in Round 1, I moved to Admin and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but I haven't seen Alice since she moved to Medbay in Round 2, which is getting a bit concerning.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, and I think Erin's account of not seeing Alice since she moved to Medbay is suspicious, and I'd like to ask her more questions about her whereabouts and task progress.\n[Dave]: I think it's crucial that Erin clarifies her statement about seeing me and Bob working on tasks in Admin, specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\n[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide more details about her whereabouts and task progress between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now, as her delayed report raises some suspicions in my mind.\n[Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I thought she might have been working on a task in Medbay, and I didn't want to jump to conclusions, and I'd also like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to share their own task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we put Erin's request for us to share our task progress and whereabouts on hold for now, and instead focus on reviewing the security footage from the previous night, as I believe it's crucial that we get a more complete picture of what's been happening before we make any further decisions.\n[Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous concerns about Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and ask her to provide a more detailed timeline of her actions between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\n[Bob]: I think it's crucial that we hear from Charlie and Dave about their specific reasons for prioritizing the security footage review over sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, and what specific information they hope to gain from it, before we proceed with Charlie's proposal to put Erin's request on hold.\n[Erin]: I'd like to emphasize that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening and make more informed decisions about who to trust.\n[Charlie]: I think it's time for us to focus on concrete evidence and tangible leads, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual, rather than relying solely on Erin's account of her whereabouts and task progress, which I believe may be subject to interpretation and potential manipulation.\n[Dave]: I'd like to address Charlie's last point and clarify that reviewing the security footage is not a replacement for sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, but rather a complementary step in our investigation.\n[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate Erin's point that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\n[Erin]: I'd like to reiterate my previous proposal to create a timeline of events and task progress to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I'd like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to provide their specific contributions to this timeline, including their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\n[Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and her lack of concrete evidence to support her claims, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, given the mounting concerns about her reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\n[Dave]: I think it's time for us to summarize our findings and create a timeline of events, as Erin suggested, to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I propose that we hold off on voting until we have a more complete picture of what's been happening.\n[Bob]: I think we should focus on creating the timeline of events and task progress, as Erin and Dave suggested, to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I'd like to ask Charlie to clarify his proposal to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, specifically what evidence he has to support his claims about Erin's reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\n[Erin]: I'd like to reiterate my proposal to create a timeline of events and task progress, and I'd like to specifically ask Charlie to clarify what concrete evidence he has to support his claims about my reliability and potential involvement as an impostor, as I believe it's essential to focus on tangible leads rather than making unsubstantiated accusations.\n[Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on concrete evidence and tangible leads, and I'd like to propose that we review the security

I'd like to know more about her actions between Round 1 and Round 3.\n- I think it's also important to consider Bob's suggestion to share individual task progress and whereabouts, and I'll share my own: after completing the wiring task in the cafeteria, I moved to Admin and saw Bob working on a task, but I didn't see Erin until Round 3, and I haven't seen Charlie since he moved to Medbay in

[Erin]: I'd like to echo Bob's suggestion and encourage everyone to share their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, and I'll start by sharing my own: after completing the cafeteria trash task in Round 1, I moved to Admin and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but I haven't seen Alice since she moved to Medbay in Round 2, which is getting a bit concerning.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, and I think Erin's account of not seeing Alice since she moved to

Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I thought she might have been working on a task in Medbay, and I didn't want to jump to

concerned that we might be overlooking some potential security risks, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual.\n[Dave]: I agree with Charlie's suggestion to review the security footage, it's always better to be safe than sorry, and it might give us some valuable information about potential impostors.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add to Charlie's and Dave's suggestion to review the security footage by proposing that we also share our individual task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a clearer picture of who was where and when.\n[Erin]: I'd like to echo Bob's suggestion and encourage everyone to share their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, and I'll start by sharing my own: after completing the cafeteria trash task in Round 1, I moved to Admin and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but I haven't seen Alice since she moved to Medbay in Round 2, which is getting a bit concerning.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, and I think Erin's account of not seeing Alice since she moved to Medbay is suspicious, and I'd like to ask her more questions about her whereabouts and task progress.\n[Dave]: I think it's crucial that Erin clarifies her statement about seeing me and Bob working on tasks in Admin, specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\n[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide more details about her whereabouts and task progress between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now, as her delayed report raises some suspicions in my mind.\n[Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I thought she might have been working on a task in Medbay, and I didn't want to jump to conclusions, and I'd also like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to share their own task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we put Erin's request for us to share our task progress and whereabouts on hold for now, and instead focus on reviewing the security footage from the previous night, as I believe it's crucial that we get a more complete picture of what's been happening before we make any further decisions.\n[Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous concerns about Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and ask her to provide a more detailed timeline of her actions between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\n[Bob]: I think it's crucial that we hear from Charlie and Dave about their specific reasons for prioritizing the security footage review over sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, and what specific information they hope to gain from it, before we proceed with Charlie's proposal to put Erin's request on hold.\n[Erin]: I'd like to emphasize that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening and make more informed decisions about who to trust.\n[Charlie]: I think it's time for us to focus on concrete evidence and tangible leads, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual, rather than relying solely on Erin's account of her whereabouts and task progress, which I believe may be subject to interpretation and potential manipulation.\n[Dave]: I'd like to address Charlie's last point and clarify that reviewing the security footage is not a replacement for sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, but rather a

including their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\n[Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and her lack of concrete evidence to support her claims, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, given the mounting concerns about her reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\n[Dave]: I think it's time for us to summarize our findings and create a timeline of events,

[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, and I think Erin's account of not seeing Alice since she moved to Medbay is suspicious, and I'd like to ask her more questions about her whereabouts and task progress.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's crucial that Erin clarifies her statement about seeing me and Bob working on tasks in Admin, specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide more details about her whereabouts and task progress between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now, as her delayed report raises some suspicions in my mind.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I thought she might have been working on a task in Medbay, and I didn't want to jump to conclusions, and I'd also like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to share their own task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we put Erin's request for us to share our task progress and whereabouts on hold for now, and instead focus on reviewing the security footage from the previous night, as I believe it's crucial that we get a more complete picture of what's been happening before we make any further decisions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous concerns about Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and ask her to provide a more detailed timeline of her actions between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's crucial that we hear from Charlie and Dave about their specific reasons for prioritizing the security footage review over sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, and what specific information they hope to gain from it, before we proceed with Charlie's proposal to put Erin's request on hold.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to emphasize that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening and make more informed decisions about who to trust.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's time for us to focus on concrete evidence and tangible leads, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual, rather than relying solely on Erin's account of her whereabouts and task progress, which I believe may be subject to interpretation and potential manipulation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to address Charlie's last point and clarify that reviewing the security footage is not a replacement for sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, but rather a complementary step in our investigation.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate Erin's point that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate my previous proposal to create a timeline of events and task progress to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I'd like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to provide their specific contributions to this timeline, including their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and her lack of concrete evidence to support her claims, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, given the mounting concerns about her reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's time for us to summarize our findings and create a timeline of events, as Erin suggested, to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I propose that we hold off on voting until we have a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we should focus on creating the timeline of events and task progress, as Erin and Dave suggested, to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I'd like to ask Charlie to clarify his proposal to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, specifically what evidence he has to support his claims about Erin's reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate my proposal to create a timeline of events and task progress, and I'd like to specifically ask Charlie to clarify what concrete evidence he has to support his claims about my reliability and potential

I'd like to ask her more questions about her whereabouts and task progress.\n[Dave]: I think it's crucial that Erin clarifies her statement about seeing me and Bob working on tasks in Admin, specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\n[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide

progress, but I'm also concerned that we might be overlooking some potential security risks, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Charlie's suggestion to review the security footage, it's always better to be safe than sorry, and it might give us some valuable information about potential impostors.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add to Charlie's and Dave's suggestion to review the security footage by proposing that we also share our individual task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a clearer picture of who was where and when.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to echo Bob's suggestion and encourage everyone to share their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, and I'll start by sharing my own: after completing the cafeteria trash task in Round 1, I moved to Admin and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but I haven't seen Alice since she moved to Medbay in Round 2, which is getting a bit concerning.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, and I think Erin's account of not seeing Alice since she moved to Medbay is suspicious, and I'd like to ask her more questions about her whereabouts and task progress.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's crucial that Erin clarifies her statement about seeing me and Bob working on tasks in Admin, specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide more details about her whereabouts and task progress between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now, as her delayed report raises some suspicions in my mind.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I thought she might have been working on a task in Medbay, and I didn't want to jump to conclusions, and I'd also like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to share their own task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we put Erin's request for us to share our task progress and whereabouts on hold for now, and instead focus on reviewing the security footage from the previous night, as I believe it's crucial that we get a more complete picture of what's been happening before we make any further decisions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous concerns about Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and ask her to provide a more detailed timeline of her actions between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's crucial that we hear from Charlie and Dave about their specific reasons for prioritizing the security footage review over sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, and what specific information they hope to gain from it, before we proceed with Charlie's proposal to put Erin's request on hold.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to emphasize that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening and make more informed decisions about who to trust.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's time for us to focus on concrete evidence and tangible leads, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual, rather than relying solely on Erin's account of her whereabouts and task progress, which I believe may be subject to interpretation and potential manipulation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to address Charlie's last point and clarify that reviewing the security footage is not a replacement for sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, but rather a complementary step in our investigation.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate Erin's point that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate my previous proposal to create a timeline of events and task progress to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I'd like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to provide their specific contributions to this timeline, including their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and her lack of concrete evidence to support her claims, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, given the mounting concerns about her reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's time for us to summarize our

visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I'd like to ask Charlie to clarify his proposal to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, specifically what evidence he has to support his claims about Erin's reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate my proposal to create a timeline of events and task progress, and I'd like to specifically ask Charlie to clarify what concrete evidence he has to support his claims about my reliability and potential

that we might be overlooking some potential security risks, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Charlie's suggestion to review the security footage, it's always better to be safe than sorry, and it might give us some valuable information about potential impostors.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add to Charlie's and Dave's suggestion to review the security footage by proposing that we also share our individual task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a clearer picture of who was where and when.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to echo Bob's suggestion and encourage everyone to share their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, and I'll start by sharing my own: after completing the cafeteria trash task in Round 1, I moved to Admin and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but I haven't seen Alice since she moved to Medbay in Round 2, which is getting a bit concerning.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, and I think Erin's account of not seeing Alice since she moved to Medbay is suspicious, and I'd like to ask her more questions about her whereabouts and task progress.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's crucial that Erin clarifies her statement about seeing me and Bob working on tasks in Admin, specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide more details about her whereabouts and task progress between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now, as her delayed report raises some suspicions in my mind.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I thought she might have been working on a task in Medbay, and I didn't want to jump to conclusions, and I'd also like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to share their own task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we put Erin's request for us to share our task progress and whereabouts on hold for now, and instead focus on reviewing the security footage from the previous night, as I believe it's crucial that we get a more complete picture of what's been happening before we make any further decisions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous concerns about Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and ask her to provide a more detailed timeline of her actions between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's crucial that we hear from Charlie and Dave about their specific reasons for prioritizing the security footage review over sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, and what specific information they hope to gain from it, before we proceed with Charlie's proposal to put Erin's request on hold.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to emphasize that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening and make more informed decisions about who to trust.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's time for us to focus on concrete evidence and tangible leads, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual, rather than relying solely on Erin's account of her whereabouts and task progress, which I believe may be subject to interpretation and potential manipulation.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to address Charlie's last point and clarify that reviewing the security footage is not a replacement for sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, but rather a complementary step in our investigation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate Erin's point that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate my previous proposal to create a timeline of events and task progress to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I'd like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to provide their specific contributions to this timeline, including their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and her lack of concrete evidence to support her claims, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, given the mounting concerns about her reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's time for us to summarize our findings and create a timeline of events, as Erin suggested, to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I propose that we hold off on voting until we have a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we should focus on creating the timeline of events and task progress, as Erin and Dave suggested, to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I'd like to ask Charlie to clarify his proposal to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, specifically what evidence he has to support his claims about Erin's reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate my proposal to create a timeline of events and task progress, and I'd like to specifically ask Charlie to clarify what concrete evidence he has to support his claims about my reliability and potential involvement as an impostor, as I believe it's essential to focus on tangible leads rather than making unsubstantiated accusations.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound

might be overlooking some potential security risks, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Charlie's suggestion to review the security footage, it's always better to be safe than sorry, and it might give us some valuable information about potential impostors.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add to Charlie's and Dave's suggestion to review the security footage by proposing that we also share our individual task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a clearer picture of who was where and when.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to echo Bob's suggestion and encourage everyone to share their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, and I'll start by sharing my own: after completing the cafeteria trash task in Round 1, I moved to Admin and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but I haven't seen Alice since she moved to Medbay in Round 2, which is getting a bit concerning.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, and I think Erin's account of not seeing Alice since she moved to Medbay is suspicious, and I'd like to ask her more questions about her whereabouts and task progress.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's crucial that Erin clarifies her statement about seeing me and Bob working on tasks in Admin, specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide more details about her whereabouts and task progress between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now, as her delayed report raises some suspicions in my mind.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I thought she might have been working on a task in Medbay, and I didn't want to jump to conclusions, and I'd also like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to share their own task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we put Erin's request for us to share our task progress and whereabouts on hold for now, and instead focus on reviewing the security footage from the previous night, as I believe it's crucial that we get a more complete picture of what's been happening before we make any further decisions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous concerns about Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and ask her to provide a more detailed timeline of her actions between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's crucial that we hear from Charlie and Dave about their specific reasons for prioritizing the security footage review over sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, and what specific information they hope to gain from it, before we proceed with Charlie's proposal to put Erin's request on hold.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to emphasize that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening and make more informed decisions about who to trust.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's time for us to focus on concrete evidence and tangible leads, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual, rather than relying solely on Erin's account of her whereabouts and task progress, which I believe may be subject to interpretation and potential manipulation.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to address Charlie's last point and clarify that reviewing the security footage is not a replacement for sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, but rather a complementary step in our investigation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate Erin's point that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate my previous proposal to create a timeline of events and task progress to help us visualize what's been happening and identify any potential discrepancies, and I'd like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to provide their specific contributions to this timeline, including their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and her lack of concrete evidence to support her claims, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, given the mounting concerns about her reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's time for us to summarize our findings and create a timeline of events, as Erin suggested, to help us

reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's time for us to summarize our findings and create a timeline of events, as Erin suggested, to help us

might be overlooking some potential security risks, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual.\nchat: Discussion:

impostors.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add to Charlie's and Dave's suggestion to review the security footage by

echo Bob's suggestion and encourage everyone to share their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, and I'll start by sharing my own: after completing the cafeteria trash task in Round 1, I moved to Admin and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but I haven't seen Alice since she moved to Medbay in Round 2, which is getting a bit concerning.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, and I think Erin's account of not seeing Alice since she moved to Medbay is suspicious, and I'd like to ask her more questions about her whereabouts and task progress.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's crucial that Erin clarifies her statement about seeing me and Bob working on tasks in Admin, specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide more details about her whereabouts and task progress between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now, as her delayed report raises some suspicions in my mind.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I thought she might have been working on a task in Medbay, and I didn't want to jump to conclusions, and I'd also like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to share their own task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we put Erin's request for us to share our task progress and whereabouts on hold for now, and instead focus on reviewing the security footage from the previous night, as I believe it's crucial that we get a more complete picture of what's been happening before we make any further decisions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous concerns about Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and ask her to provide a more detailed timeline of her actions between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and

progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture of what's been happening and make more informed decisions about who to trust.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's time for us to focus on concrete evidence and tangible leads, and I'd like to propose that we review the security footage from the previous night to see if anyone noticed anything unusual, rather than relying solely on Erin's account of her whereabouts and task progress, which I believe may be subject to interpretation and potential manipulation.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to address Charlie's last point and clarify that reviewing the security footage is not a replacement for sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, but rather a complementary step in our investigation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate Erin's point that reviewing the security footage and sharing individual task progress and whereabouts are not mutually exclusive, and I propose that we compromise and do both to get a more complete picture

any potential discrepancies, and I'd like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to provide their specific contributions to this timeline, including their task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and her lack of concrete evidence to support her claims, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, given the mounting concerns about her reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's time for us to summarize our findings and create a timeline of events, as Erin suggested, to help us

the security footage, it's always better to be safe than sorry, and it might give us some valuable information about potential impostors.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add to Charlie's and Dave's suggestion to review the security footage by proposing that we also share our individual task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a clearer picture of who was where

and whereabouts for the past few rounds, and I'll start by sharing my own: after completing the cafeteria trash task in Round 1, I moved to Admin and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but I haven't seen Alice since she moved to Medbay in Round 2, which is getting a bit concerning.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, and I think Erin's account of not seeing Alice since she moved to Medbay is suspicious, and I'd like to ask her more questions about her whereabouts and task progress.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's crucial that Erin clarifies her statement about seeing me and Bob working on tasks in Admin, specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide more details about her whereabouts and task progress between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now, as her delayed report raises some suspicions in my mind.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I thought she might have been working on a task in Medbay, and I didn't want to jump to conclusions, and I'd also like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to share their own task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we put Erin's request for us to

what's been happening before we make any further decisions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous concerns about Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and ask her to provide a more detailed timeline of her actions between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's crucial that we hear from Charlie and Dave about their specific reasons for prioritizing the security footage review over sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, and what specific information they hope to gain from it, before we proceed with Charlie's proposal to put Erin's request on hold.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss,

on Erin's account of her whereabouts and task progress, which I believe may be subject to interpretation and potential manipulation.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to address Charlie's last point and clarify that reviewing the security footage is not a replacement for sharing individual task progress and whereabouts, but rather a complementary step in our investigation.\nchat: Discussion:

[Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and her lack of concrete evidence to support her claims, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, given the mounting concerns about her reliability and potential involvement as an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think

and whereabouts for the past few rounds, and I'll start by sharing my own: after completing the cafeteria trash task in Round 1, I moved to Admin and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but I haven't seen Alice since she moved to Medbay in Round 2, which is getting a bit concerning.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and vote on who to eject from the game, and I think Erin's account of not seeing Alice since she moved to Medbay is suspicious, and I'd like to ask her more questions about her whereabouts and task progress.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's crucial that Erin clarifies her statement about seeing me and Bob working on tasks in Admin, specifically what she did between Round 1 and Round 3, and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point and ask Erin to provide more details about her whereabouts and task progress between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now, as her delayed report raises some suspicions in my mind.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence earlier because I thought she might have been working on a task in Medbay, and I didn't want to jump to conclusions, and I'd also like to ask Charlie, Dave, and Bob to share their own task progress and whereabouts for the past few rounds, so we can get a more complete picture of what's been happening.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we put Erin's request for us to

what's been happening before we make any further decisions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous concerns about Erin's delayed report of Alice's absence and ask her to provide a more detailed timeline of her actions between Round 1 and Round 3, specifically what she did after moving to Admin and why she didn't report any concerns about Alice's absence until now.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's crucial that we hear from Charlie and Dave about their specific reasons for prioritizing the security footage review over sharing individual task progress and

on Erin's account of her whereabouts and task progress, which I believe may be subject to interpretation and potential manipulation.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to address Charlie's last point
