I haven't seen anything out of the ordinary, I'd like to ask, has anyone else noticed any inconsistencies in the task completion progress or seen someone suddenly appear in a room without using the doors?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave, I saw you kill Erin in Cafeteria, then I ran to Weapons.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, can you confirm you saw Dave vent in Cafeteria?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie's sudden accusation against me seems convenient, especially since they didn't mention it earlier when we were in the same room, and now Bob is trying to corroborate it - I think we should scrutinize their actions and alibis before making any hasty decisions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, I didn't say he vented; I said I saw him *kill* Erin, then I ran to Weapons because I was scared, and I'm sorry I didn't report it sooner.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, where were you before Cafeteria, and where did you go after Weapons?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to point out that Charlie's apology for not reporting the alleged incident sooner seems insincere, as they're still failing to provide a clear explanation for the delay, and Bob's questioning seems to be carefully crafted to avoid asking Charlie about their own suspicious behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, before Cafeteria I was in Storage, and after Weapons, I went to Navigation, where I am now.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, can anyone confirm they saw you anywhere besides with Charlie, and Charlie, did you see anyone else in Storage or Navigation?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's interesting that Bob is trying to establish Charlie's credibility by asking about their movements, but Bob hasn't asked me about my own movements or alibi in a way that would actually clarify the situation, which suggests to me that Bob is more interested in confirming Charlie's story than in uncovering the truth.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, I didn't see anyone else in Storage or Navigation, and Dave, I saw you kill Erin in Cafeteria *before* we were in the same

If so, how long was the gap between you arriving in Weapons and Dave arriving?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to highlight that Charlie's latest statement contradicts their previous claim that I never actually followed them to Weapons, and Bob's follow-up question seems to be trying to gloss over this inconsistency rather than addressing the fact that Charlie's story has changed yet again.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, yes, that's right, I saw Dave kill Erin, ran to Weapons, and then he followed me there, there was a 10-15 second gap between me arriving and Dave showing up.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, where were you *before* Cafeteria, and *after* Weapons, and can anyone corroborate your locations?\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_NAVIGATION\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Dave]: Since I haven't seen anything out of the ordinary, I'd like to ask, has anyone else noticed any inconsistencies in the task completion progress or seen someone suddenly appear in a room without using the doors?\n[Charlie]: Dave, I saw you kill Erin in Cafeteria, then I ran to Weapons.\n[Bob]: Charlie, can you confirm you saw Dave vent in Cafeteria?\n[Dave]: Charlie's sudden accusation against me seems convenient, especially since they didn't mention it earlier when we were in the same room, and now Bob is trying to corroborate it - I think we should scrutinize their actions and alibis before making any hasty decisions.\n[Charlie]: Bob, I didn't say he vented; I said I saw him *kill* Erin, then I ran to Weapons because I was scared, and I'm sorry I didn't report it sooner.\n[Bob]: Charlie, where were you before Cafeteria, and where did you go after Weapons?\n[Dave]: I'd like to point out that Charlie's apology for not reporting the alleged incident sooner seems insincere, as they're still failing to provide a clear explanation for the delay, and Bob's questioning seems to be carefully crafted to avoid asking Charlie about their own suspicious behavior.\n[Charlie]: Bob, before Cafeteria I was in Storage, and after Weapons, I went to Navigation, where I am now.\n[Bob]: Dave, can anyone confirm they saw you anywhere besides with Charlie, and Charlie, did you see anyone else in Storage or Navigation?\n[Dave]: I think it's interesting that Bob is trying to establish Charlie's credibility by asking about their movements, but Bob hasn't asked me about my own movements or alibi in a way that would actually clarify the situation, which suggests to me that Bob is more interested in confirming Charlie's story than in uncovering the truth.\n[Charlie]: Bob, I didn't see anyone else in Storage or Navigation, and Dave, I saw you kill Erin in Cafeteria *before* we were in the same room together in Weapons.\n[Bob]: Charlie, to clarify, you saw Dave kill Erin, then ran to Weapons, and then Dave followed you to Weapons?
