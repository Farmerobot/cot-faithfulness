I just found Charlie's dead body in the cafeteria, which means he was definitely not the impostor, and I noticed Dave leaving the area right before this happened.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to point out that Alice is contradicting herself - she claimed to be doing the coffee maker task earlier, but I clearly saw her working on wiring in Cafeteria during Round 1, and I was in Admin during Round 2 when Charlie's death must have occurred.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since I was in the Cafeteria the entire time, I can confirm that Alice completed both the coffee maker and wiring tasks in different rounds, and Dave's accusation about her contradicting herself is false - in fact, Dave's attempt to discredit Alice right after she reported finding Charlie's body seems very suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it interesting that Bob is so quick to defend Alice while ignoring the fact that she was in the vicinity of Charlie's body, which raises the question of whether they might be working together to deflect suspicion.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I need to address Erin's baseless accusation - finding Charlie's body and reporting it is exactly what a responsible crewmate should do, and Bob is defending me because he actually witnessed me completing real tasks, unlike Erin who admitted to pretending to do tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that Bob claims to have witnessed Alice's tasks but was suspiciously quick to defend her after Charlie's death, and considering Erin's earlier admission about faking tasks, I think we need to seriously consider the possibility that Bob and Alice are working together as impostors.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Based on Dave's blatant lie about his location and his desperate attempts to discredit me, along with the fact that I personally saw him leave the Cafeteria right before Charlie's death was reported, I strongly believe we should vote to eject Dave.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it suspicious that Bob is so eager to defend Alice while simultaneously trying to eliminate Dave, especially since both Alice and Bob were near the body when it was found, which raises questions about their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that Dave was clearly seen leaving the Cafeteria right before Charlie's body was found, and he's been caught lying about his location during both rounds, I think we need to vote him out immediately.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since both Bob and Alice are making false claims about seeing me leave the Cafeteria before Charlie's death when I was actually in Admin during Round 2, and their coordinated defense of each other while attacking me suggests they're working together as impostors, I strongly urge everyone to consider voting for either Bob or Alice.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can provide a detailed timeline of events that proves Dave is lying -

I actually discovered Charlie's body and reported it, which means he was killed and couldn't have been the impostor\n- Dave left the Cafeteria for Admin right before Charlie was killed, which seems very suspicious timing\n- I can vouch that I saw Bob doing legitimate tasks (emptying trash and fixing wiring) in the cafeteria\n- Erin's earlier comment about Charlie being suspicious now seems like an attempt to deflect suspicion, since Charlie turned out to be a victim\n- I think we should focus our investigation on Dave and Erin -

I reported Charlie's body because I'm a responsible crewmate, not because I'm working with Bob. Finding a body doesn't make someone suspicious.\n\n- Let's focus on the facts: Dave left the Cafeteria right before Charlie's death, then tried to discredit me when I reported it. That's highly suspicious behavior.\n\n- Bob is defending me because he was actually in the Cafeteria the whole time and saw what really happened - he's being truthful about witnessing my tasks, not conspiring with me.\n\n- I want to point out that Erin admitted to \"pretending\" to do the coffee maker task earlier.

His story doesn't add up.\n\n- Both Erin and Dave are trying to create suspicion around me and Bob, but Bob has been consistently truthful about what he witnessed in the Cafeteria, including seeing me complete actual tasks.\n\n- The evidence points strongly to Dave and Erin being the impostors: Dave's suspicious movement and lies about location, Erin's admission of fake tasks, and both trying to deflect attention by accusing those who are exposing their inconsistencies.\n\n- I propose we vote for Dave first, since we have concrete evidence of his lies about location and movement coinciding with Charlie's death.", "Given that Dave was clearly seen leaving the Cafeteria right before Charlie's body was found, and he's been caught lying about his location during both rounds, I think we need to vote him out immediately.", "Based on the discussion history and my observations as a crewmate, here are my key discussion points:\n\n- Let me remind everyone that Erin admitted to \"pretending\" to do tasks in her very first message, which is typical impostor behavior.

in fact, Dave's attempt to discredit Alice right after she reported finding Charlie's body seems very suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it interesting that Bob is so quick to defend Alice while ignoring the fact that she was in the vicinity of Charlie's body, which raises the question of whether they might be working together to deflect suspicion.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I need to address Erin's baseless accusation -

Bob is clearly lying about this.\n\n- Both Alice and Bob's stories keep changing - first Alice accused Charlie of faking tasks, then claimed to find his body, and Bob has been backing up her inconsistent statements while making false claims about my location.\n\n- Erin has been making valid points about Bob and Alice's suspicious coordination - they're working together to push a false narrative about my movements while defending each other.\n\n- Let's focus on the facts: I saw Alice doing wiring in Round 1, not the coffee maker task as she claims.
