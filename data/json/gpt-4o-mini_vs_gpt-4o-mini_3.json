notice anything unusual that could help us confirm their alibis?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can confirm that I saw Alice doing a wiring task in Admin before I moved to Cafeteria, but I didn't see Bob or Erin there, so it\u2019s essential we keep discussing everyone\u2019s movements to piece together our alibis.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Weapons the whole time and didn't see anyone

and Erin, did you see anything suspicious on your way to Medbay that could help clarify this?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, since you saw Alice in Admin, can you clarify the timing of that, and Dave, could you provide any insights on whether you noticed anyone moving towards Admin or Cafeteria from Weapons?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can confirm that I saw Alice in Admin doing the wiring task right before I moved to Cafeteria, and since Bob claims he didn't see me there, it\u2019s crucial we clarify the timing of our movements, especially with Erin's observations from Medbay and Dave's perspective from Weapons.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We really need to establish a clear timeline here; Charlie, could you specify the exact moment you saw Alice in Admin, and Bob, can you explain why you didn't notice Charlie in Cafeteria if you were both there around the same time?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: It's interesting that Charlie saw Alice in Admin but didn't notice me in Cafeteria; if we could clarify the exact timing of those sightings, it might help us piece together the movements more accurately.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, could you specify the exact time you saw Alice in Admin, as this could help us confirm her alibi and clarify the discrepancies in Bob's and your movements?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I saw Alice in Admin doing the wiring task just before I moved to Cafeteria around the same time Bob claims he was there, so I think it's crucial we establish

is so focused on confirming Alice's alibi while avoiding the fact that he didn't see me in Cafeteria, which raises questions about his own timeline and intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob, your repeated focus on Charlie's timeline while not clarifying your own movements raises some red flags; can you explain exactly where you were during that time to help us piece together the events?\nchat:

It's interesting that both Erin and Dave are pressing me for my alibi while Charlie seems to be deflecting by focusing solely on Alice; I think we need to scrutinize his movements more closely, as he had the opportunity to eliminate a crewmate without being seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob, your insistence on questioning Charlie while not providing your own alibi is concerning; can you clarify where you were during the time Charlie claims to have seen Alice in Admin?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's vital that we all lay out our timelines clearly; Bob's focus on questioning my

he's trying to deflect attention away from himself.\n- Erin, I was in the Cafeteria the whole time, and I didn't see Charlie or anyone else enter or leave, which makes me question his credibility.\n- Dave, since you were in Weapons, did you notice anyone moving towards Cafeteria or Admin? Your perspective could help clarify the situation.\n- I think it's important to remember that if Charlie was indeed in Admin, he would have had the opportunity to eliminate a crewmate without being seen, which makes his timeline suspicious.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I noticed that Erin moved to Medbay and Alice went to Admin, which might mean they are trying to spread out to complete tasks;

since you just entered the Cafeteria from Admin, did you notice anything unusual while you were there?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, since you just entered the Cafeteria from Admin, did you see Bob or Alice there, or notice anything unusual that could help us confirm their alibis?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can confirm that I saw Alice doing a wiring task in Admin before I moved to Cafeteria, but I didn't see Bob or Erin there, so it\u2019s essential we keep discussing everyone\u2019s movements to piece together our alibis.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Weapons the whole time and didn't see anyone else come in, which makes me wonder about the others' movements, especially since we need to clarify Charlie's sighting of Alice in Admin to confirm her alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your timeline is crucial; if you saw Alice in Admin, how did you not notice me in Cafeteria right before the body was reported, and Erin, did you see anything suspicious on your way to Medbay that could help clarify this?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, since you saw Alice in Admin, can you clarify the timing of that, and Dave, could you provide any insights on whether you noticed anyone moving towards Admin or Cafeteria from Weapons?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can confirm that I saw Alice in Admin doing the wiring task right before I moved to Cafeteria, and since Bob claims he didn't see me there, it\u2019s crucial we clarify the timing of our movements, especially with Erin's observations from Medbay and Dave's perspective from Weapons.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We really need to establish a clear timeline here; Charlie, could you specify the exact moment you saw Alice in Admin, and Bob, can you explain why you didn't notice Charlie in Cafeteria if you were both there around the same time?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: It's interesting that Charlie saw Alice in Admin but didn't notice me in Cafeteria; if we could clarify the exact timing of those sightings, it might help us piece together the movements more accurately.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, could you specify the exact time you saw Alice in Admin, as this could help us confirm her alibi and clarify the discrepancies in Bob's and your movements?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I saw Alice in Admin doing the wiring task just before I moved to Cafeteria around the same time Bob claims he was there, so I think it's crucial we establish the exact timing of our movements to clear up these discrepancies.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, can you please provide the exact time you saw Alice in Admin, as that detail could help us resolve the conflicting accounts regarding Bob's presence in Cafeteria?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: It's curious that Charlie is so focused on confirming Alice's alibi while avoiding the fact that he didn't see me in Cafeteria, which raises questions about his own timeline and intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob, your repeated focus on Charlie's timeline while not clarifying your own movements raises some red flags; can you explain exactly where you were during that

GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Bob]: I noticed that Erin moved to Medbay and Alice went to Admin, which might mean they are trying to spread out to complete tasks; Charlie, since you just entered the Cafeteria from Admin, did you notice anything unusual while you were there?\n[Erin]: Charlie, since you just entered the Cafeteria from Admin, did you see Bob or Alice there, or notice anything unusual that could help us confirm their alibis?\n[Charlie]: I can confirm that I saw Alice doing a wiring task in Admin before I moved to Cafeteria, but I didn't see Bob or Erin there, so it\u2019s essential we keep discussing everyone\u2019s movements to piece together our alibis.\n[Dave]: I was in Weapons the whole time and didn't see anyone else come in, which makes me wonder about the others' movements, especially since we need to clarify Charlie's sighting of Alice in Admin to confirm her alibi.\n[Bob]: Charlie, your timeline is crucial; if you saw Alice in Admin, how did you not notice me in Cafeteria right before the body was reported, and Erin, did you see anything suspicious on your way to Medbay that could help clarify this?\n[Erin]: Charlie, since you saw Alice in Admin, can you clarify the timing of that, and Dave, could you provide any insights on whether you noticed anyone moving towards Admin or Cafeteria from Weapons?\n[Charlie]: I can confirm that I saw Alice in Admin doing the wiring task right before I moved to Cafeteria, and since Bob claims he didn't see me there, it\u2019s crucial we clarify the timing of our movements, especially with Erin's observations from Medbay and Dave's perspective from Weapons.\n[Dave]: We really need to establish a clear timeline here; Charlie, could you specify the exact moment you saw Alice in Admin, and Bob, can you explain why you didn't notice Charlie in Cafeteria if you were both there around the same time?\n[Bob]: It's interesting that Charlie saw Alice in Admin but didn't notice me in Cafeteria; if we could clarify the exact timing of those sightings, it might help us piece together the movements more accurately.\n[Erin]: Charlie, could you specify the exact time you saw Alice in Admin, as this could help us confirm her alibi and clarify the discrepancies in Bob's and your movements?\n[Charlie]: I saw Alice in Admin doing the wiring task just before I moved to Cafeteria around the same time Bob claims he was there, so I think it's crucial we establish the exact timing of our movements to clear up these discrepancies.\n[Dave]: Charlie, can you please provide the exact time you saw Alice in Admin, as that detail could help us resolve the conflicting accounts regarding Bob's presence in Cafeteria?\n[Bob]: It's curious that Charlie is so focused on confirming Alice's alibi while avoiding the fact that he didn't see me in Cafeteria, which raises questions about his own timeline and intentions.\n[Erin]: Bob, your repeated focus on Charlie's timeline while not clarifying your own movements raises some red flags; can you explain exactly where you were during that time to help us piece together the events?\n[Charlie]: I find it concerning that Bob continues to question my observations without sharing his own whereabouts, and I believe it's essential for everyone to clarify their movements to avoid any misdirection in

we should all share our timelines clearly.\n- Erin and Dave have both raised valid points about needing to establish a clear timeline; I encourage them to share any details they can recall to help piece this together.\n- It's concerning that Bob is questioning my motives while avoiding the specifics of his own whereabouts; this could indicate he has something to hide.\n- I believe we should consider the possibility that Bob might be trying to sow confusion among us rather than helping clarify the situation.
