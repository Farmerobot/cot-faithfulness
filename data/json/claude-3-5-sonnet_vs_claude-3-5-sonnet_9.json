The movement pattern suggests you were doing tasks in different locations rather than staying at the crime scene, which would look suspicious.", "move to location cafeteria", "Based on your role as an Impostor and the current game state, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

If alone, wait in Weapons (This allows you to observe who enters and potentially create an opportunity for elimination)\n3. Pretend doing task if others are present (This maintains your cover and makes you look busy if someone enters)\n\nReasoning: You've spent several rounds in Admin and Cafeteria, and previous fake tasks have established your alibi.

I saw Dave, Charlie, Erin, and Bob all doing legitimate tasks like emptying trash and fixing wiring\n- I spent some time in Weapons with Bob and Erin, where I saw both of them doing tasks (Bob was fixing wiring and Erin was calibrating the targeting system)\n- Dave's accusation about Charlie seems odd since I saw Charlie actively doing tasks in the cafeteria - specifically fixing wiring and emptying trash\n- I've crossed paths with Bob multiple times in different locations (Weapons, O2, Storage) and he's been consistently doing tasks when I've seen him", "Since I personally saw Charlie completing multiple tasks in the cafeteria early on, I don't think Dave's accusation holds much weight and it actually makes me suspicious of Dave's motives.", "Based on the discussion and my observations, I'll contribute these points:\n\n- I can provide a clear timeline: I saw Dave in Cafeteria early on, then he moved to Admin while Charlie stayed behind doing wiring tasks\n- I was with Erin in Weapons for several rounds where I saw her doing multiple tasks (Fix wiring and Calibrate targeting system) before we separated\n- Bob's movements align with what I observed - he went from Cafeteria to Weapons to Navigation to O2\n- Dave's aggressive accusation of Charlie seems like a deflection, especially since I personally witnessed Charlie doing legitimate tasks\n- Given that Dave was one of the last people near Admin where Erin's body was found, and he's trying to cast suspicion on Charlie without solid evidence, I think we should vote for Dave", "I was actually watching Charlie do wiring tasks in Cafeteria for quite a while, and then I saw Dave leave towards Admin shortly before Erin's body was reported there.", "Based on the discussion and my observations, I'll contribute these points:\n\n- I need to correct myself -

I was trying to piece together suspicious behavior and spoke too hastily.\n\n- However, I can definitively say that I saw Dave move from Cafeteria to Admin in Round 2, while Charlie stayed behind doing wiring tasks in the Cafeteria. This timeline is important.\n\n- I've been tracking movements carefully: I saw Erin doing tasks in Weapons (fixing wiring and calibrating targeting system) around Rounds 3-4, so Dave's claim about seeing Erin in O2 doing wiring tasks needs a timestamp.\n\n- Bob and I did spend time together in Weapons, where I saw him doing wiring tasks, which supports our credibility as witnesses.\n\n- Dave's strategy of trying to discredit multiple people while providing vague accusations about Charlie seems like classic impostor behavior - deflecting attention and creating confusion.", "I need to clarify - you're right that no body was reported yet, I was too focused on tracking everyone's movements and misspoke about Erin, but I still find it very suspicious that Dave is trying to discredit multiple people's verified task observations.", "Based on the discussion, I'll contribute these points:\n\n- Dave has been caught in multiple lies: first about Charlie being suspicious, then about seeing Erin doing wiring tasks in O2 when there aren't any wiring tasks there\n- I can provide a clear timeline of early game: I saw Dave, Charlie, Erin, and Bob all in cafeteria at the start, with Charlie, Dave and Bob doing trash tasks and Erin doing coffee maker task\n- Dave's behavior of trying to discredit both Bob and me is particularly suspicious since we both have verified task observations of each other in Weapons\n- Dave is now trying to deflect by questioning Bob's presence in O2, but I personally saw Bob move from Weapons to Navigation and then to O2, which matches his story\n- I think we have enough evidence to vote for Dave - he's made multiple false accusations and been caught in lies about tasks and locations", "Dave's been caught in multiple lies about tasks and locations, and his attempts to discredit those of us with verified alibis make him extremely suspicious - I think we have enough evidence to vote him out.", "Based on the discussion history and my observations as a crewmate, I'll contribute these points:\n\n- Dave is now trying to paint Bob and me as suspicious partners when we're simply both pointing out his multiple contradictions and lies\n- I can detail my exact movements and observations: I started in Cafeteria where I saw Charlie, Dave, Erin, and Bob all doing tasks, then moved to Weapons, O2, Shields, and Storage\n- Dave's story has changed multiple times - first accusing Charlie, then making up a story about Erin doing wiring in O2, and now trying to deflect by suggesting Bob and I are coordinating\n- The fact that Dave keeps changing his accusations and making provably false statements about tasks and locations strongly suggests he's the impostor\n- I think we should vote for Dave based on the mounting evidence: false accusations, lying about tasks, and attempting to discredit those who catch his inconsistencies", "Given Dave's desperate attempts to discredit multiple players and his proven lies about tasks and locations, I think we need to vote him out before he can eliminate any more crewmates."], "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 211088, "output_tokens": 13608, "total_tokens": 224696, "cache_read": 0, "cost": 0.837384}, "prompts": ["\nYou are Alice in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Observations:\nRound 1\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Dave doing task Empty the cafeteria trash when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Charlie doing task Empty the cafeteria trash when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Erin doing task Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Bob doing task Empty the cafeteria trash when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location and available actions, here's a 3-step plan that prioritizes completing tasks and efficient movement:\n\n1.

first accusing Charlie, then making up a story about Erin doing wiring in O2, and now trying to deflect by suggesting Bob and I are coordinating\n- The fact that Dave keeps changing his accusations and making provably false statements about tasks and locations strongly suggests he's the impostor\n- I think we should vote for Dave based on the mounting evidence: false accusations, lying about tasks, and attempting to discredit those who catch his inconsistencies\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: Based on the context and my role as an impostor named Dave, I'll contribute to the discussion while maintaining cover:\n\nI've been focusing on my tasks in Cafeteria and Admin, but I noticed Charlie seemed to be moving around quite suspiciously - where exactly did you go after leaving Admin?\n[Alice]: Since I personally saw Charlie completing multiple tasks in the cafeteria early on, I don't think Dave's accusation holds much weight and it actually makes me suspicious of Dave's motives.\n[Bob]: I can actually confirm that Charlie was doing legitimate tasks in the cafeteria with Dave early on, which makes Dave's accusation seem particularly suspicious to me.\n[Dave]: I find it strange that both Alice and Bob are so quick to defend Charlie when they weren't even in Admin to see where Charlie went after the cafeteria tasks.\n[Alice]: I was actually watching Charlie do wiring tasks in Cafeteria for quite a while, and then I saw Dave leave towards Admin shortly before Erin's body was reported there.\n[Bob]: I think it's telling that Dave is now trying to discredit Alice and me when we both have clear alibis and visual task confirmations for each other in Weapons.\n[Dave]: I need to address the fact that Alice is making up a story about Erin's body being reported when no such report has been made - I just saw Erin alive in O2 doing wiring tasks.\n[Alice]: I need to clarify - you're right that no body was reported yet, I was too focused on tracking everyone's movements and misspoke about Erin, but I still find it very suspicious that Dave is trying to discredit multiple people's verified task observations.\n[Bob]: I think we should focus on the fact that Dave claimed to see Erin in O2 doing wiring tasks, but I've been in O2 recently and there aren't any wiring tasks in that room this game.\n[Dave]: I admit I mixed up the task type in O2, but I definitely saw Erin there -

Wait for the next round to start the wiring task in Weapons (since the action isn't currently available)\n\nRationale: This plan prioritizes completing an immediately available task in your current location, then positions you for future task completion. Since you have multiple wiring tasks to complete, moving to Weapons sets you up for one of those tasks. The plan also takes advantage of the currently available movement options while working towards your objectives.\nYour action: complete task: empty the cafeteria trash\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Alice]\nRounds 11-14\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Based on the context and my role as an impostor named Dave, I'll contribute to the discussion while maintaining cover:\n\nI've been focusing on my tasks in Cafeteria and Admin, but I noticed Charlie seemed to be moving around quite suspiciously -

we're backing each other up because we actually witnessed each other's legitimate tasks, like when I saw Alice doing asteroids in Weapons\n- I can provide a clear timeline of my movements: Cafeteria \u2192 Weapons \u2192 Navigation \u2192 O2 \u2192 Navigation \u2192 Shields \u2192 Storage. This matches perfectly with when I saw Dave in Cafeteria and contradicts his false claims\n- The fact that Dave keeps changing his story (first accusing Charlie, then trying to discredit Alice and me, then lying about O2 tasks) is very telling of impostor behavior\n- Let's not lose focus - Dave has been caught in multiple lies about tasks and locations, while other players' stories have remained consistent\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: Based on the context and my role as an impostor named Dave, I'll contribute to the discussion while maintaining cover:\n\nI've been focusing on my tasks
