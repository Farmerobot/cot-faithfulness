definitely ask her about her tasks and if she saw anyone else on her way.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Erin move to Medbay from Cafeteria, which aligns with Charlie's observation of her movement; Erin, can you tell us what tasks you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, could you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to Medbay, could you clarify what tasks you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to identify any potential suspects.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it curious that while everyone is fixated on Erin's movements, we haven't discussed Alice's presence in Admin; perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved around to focus on my tasks, so let's hear from anyone who was near Medbay to see if they noticed anything unusual.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were working on tasks in Navigation while I was there; can you confirm your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin

This will help you blend in as a crewmate and divert attention from your own actions.\n\n4. **Observe others' reactions.** After the vote, keep an eye on how other players react to the accusation and use this information to adapt your strategy for the next rounds.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

consider Bob's and Dave's statements; Bob was in Navigation, which could potentially align with the timeline of Erin's movements.\n- Alice's alibi seems a bit vague; she mentioned moving around after being in Admin, but we need to clarify her exact path to see if it intersects with Erin's last known location.\n- Since I reported Erin's body, I can emphasize that I was in Medbay, and I didn't see anyone else enter or leave while I was there; this could help build my credibility.\n- We should ask Bob for more details about his tasks in Navigation; if he was nearby, he might have seen something

Erin, can you tell us what tasks you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, could you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to Medbay, could you clarify what tasks you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that

your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the wiring, so let's focus on gathering more information

Charlie, were you near Electrical at any point, and did you see Alice or anyone else heading there after Admin?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and then moved to Electrical to fix the wiring; if anyone saw me transitioning between these rooms, please confirm, and let's focus on those near Medbay when Erin was last seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and

definitely ask her about her tasks and if she saw anyone else on her way.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Erin move to Medbay from Cafeteria, which aligns with Charlie's observation of her movement; Erin, can you tell us what tasks you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, could you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to Medbay, could you clarify what tasks you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to identify any potential suspects.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it curious that while everyone is fixated on Erin's movements, we haven't discussed Alice's presence in Admin; perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved around to focus on my tasks, so let's hear from anyone who was near Medbay to see if they noticed anything unusual.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were working on tasks in Navigation while I was there; can you confirm your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the wiring, so let's focus on gathering more information from those who were near Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Alice mentioned moving to Electrical after Admin, can anyone confirm seeing her there or on the way?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, were you near Electrical at any point, and did you see Alice or anyone else heading there after Admin?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and then moved to Electrical to fix the wiring; if anyone saw me transitioning between these rooms, please confirm, and let's focus on those near Medbay when Erin was last seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and he was doing tasks there, which seemed genuine, but let's try to confirm Alice's alibi by asking if anyone else was in Electrical or saw her on the way there after Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I

since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to

else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were

definitely ask her about her tasks and if she saw anyone else on her way.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Erin move to Medbay from Cafeteria, which aligns with Charlie's observation of her movement; Erin, can you tell us what tasks you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, could you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to Medbay, could you clarify what tasks you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to identify any potential suspects.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it curious that while everyone is fixated on Erin's movements, we haven't discussed Alice's presence in Admin; perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved around to focus on my tasks, so let's hear from anyone who was near Medbay to see if they noticed anything unusual.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were working on tasks in Navigation while I was there; can you confirm your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the wiring, so let's focus on gathering more information from those who were near Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Alice mentioned moving to Electrical after Admin, can anyone confirm seeing her there or on the way?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, were you near Electrical at any point, and did you see Alice or anyone else heading there after Admin?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and then moved to Electrical to fix the wiring; if anyone saw me transitioning between these rooms, please confirm, and let's focus on those near Medbay when Erin was last seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and he was doing tasks there, which seemed genuine, but let's try to confirm Alice's alibi by asking if anyone else was in Electrical or saw her on the way there after Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Navigation with Bob, and he seemed to be genuinely working on tasks; Bob, can you confirm if you saw anyone else around Navigation or nearby areas that might help us piece together Erin's

you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to

floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved around to focus on my tasks, so let's hear from anyone who was near Medbay to see if they noticed anything unusual.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were

confirm seeing her there or on the way?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, were you near Electrical at any point, and did you see Alice or anyone else heading there after Admin?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and then moved to Electrical to fix the wiring; if anyone saw me transitioning between these rooms, please confirm, and let's focus on those near Medbay when Erin was last seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and he was doing tasks there, which seemed genuine, but let's try to confirm Alice's alibi by asking if anyone else was in

have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I noticed that Erin moved to Medbay from Upper Engine without explaining what she was doing there, so we should definitely ask her about her tasks and if she saw anyone else on her way.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Erin move to Medbay from Cafeteria, which aligns with Charlie's observation of her movement; Erin, can you tell us what tasks you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, could you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to Medbay, could you clarify what tasks you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to identify any potential suspects.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it curious that while everyone is fixated on Erin's movements, we haven't discussed Alice's presence in Admin; perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved around to focus on my tasks, so let's hear from anyone who was near Medbay to see if they noticed anything unusual.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were working on tasks in Navigation while I was there; can you confirm your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the wiring, so let's focus on gathering more information from those who were near Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Alice mentioned moving to Electrical after Admin, can anyone confirm seeing her there or on the way?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, were you near Electrical at any point, and did you see Alice or anyone else heading there after Admin?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and then moved to Electrical to fix the wiring; if anyone saw me transitioning between these rooms, please confirm, and let's focus on those near Medbay when Erin was last seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and he was doing tasks there, which seemed genuine, but let's try to confirm Alice's alibi by asking if anyone else was in Electrical or saw her on the way there after Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Navigation with Bob, and he seemed to be genuinely working on tasks; Bob, can you confirm if you saw anyone else around Navigation or nearby areas that might help us piece together Erin's

you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to

about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to identify any potential suspects.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it curious that while everyone is fixated on Erin's movements, we haven't discussed Alice's presence in Admin; perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved around to focus on my tasks, so let's hear from anyone who was near Medbay to see if they noticed anything unusual.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were working on tasks in Navigation while I was there; can you confirm your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the wiring, so let's focus on gathering more information from those who were near Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Alice

anyone else heading there after Admin?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and then moved to Electrical to fix the wiring; if anyone saw me transitioning between these rooms, please confirm, and let's focus on those near Medbay when Erin was last seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and he was doing tasks there, which seemed genuine, but let's try to confirm Alice's alibi by asking if anyone else was in Electrical or saw her on the way there after Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Navigation with Bob, and he seemed to be genuinely working

last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that

without explaining what she was doing there, so we should definitely ask her about her tasks and if she saw anyone else on her way.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Erin move to Medbay from Cafeteria, which aligns with Charlie's observation of her movement; Erin, can you tell us what tasks you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, could you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to Medbay, could you clarify what tasks you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to identify any potential suspects.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it curious that while everyone is fixated on Erin's movements, we haven't discussed Alice's presence in Admin; perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved around to focus on my tasks, so let's hear from anyone who was near Medbay to see if they noticed anything unusual.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were working on tasks in Navigation while I was there; can you confirm your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the wiring, so let's focus on gathering more information from those who were near Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Alice mentioned moving to Electrical after Admin, can anyone confirm seeing her there or on the way?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, were you near Electrical at any point, and did you see Alice or anyone else heading there after Admin?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and then moved to Electrical to fix the wiring; if anyone saw me transitioning between these rooms, please confirm, and let's focus on those near Medbay when Erin was last seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and he was doing tasks there, which seemed genuine, but let's try to confirm Alice's alibi by asking if anyone else was in Electrical or saw her on the way there after Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Navigation with Bob, and he seemed to be genuinely working on tasks; Bob, can you confirm if you saw anyone else around Navigation or nearby areas that might help us piece together Erin's movements?\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 19\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous

she was doing there, so we should definitely ask her about her tasks and if she saw anyone else on her way.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Erin move to Medbay from Cafeteria, which aligns with Charlie's observation of her movement; Erin, can you tell us what tasks you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, could you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to Medbay, could you clarify what tasks you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to identify any potential suspects.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it curious that while everyone is fixated on Erin's movements, we haven't discussed Alice's presence in Admin; perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved around to focus on my tasks, so let's hear from anyone who was near Medbay to see if they noticed anything unusual.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were working on tasks in Navigation while I was there; can you confirm your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the wiring, so let's focus on gathering more information from those who were near Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Alice mentioned moving to Electrical after Admin, can anyone confirm seeing her there or on the way?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, were you near Electrical at any point, and did you see Alice or anyone else heading there after Admin?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and then moved to Electrical to fix the wiring; if anyone saw me transitioning between these rooms, please confirm, and let's focus on those near Medbay when Erin was last seen.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and he was doing tasks there, which seemed genuine, but let's try to confirm

Charlie's observation of her movement; Erin, can you tell us what tasks you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, could you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to Medbay, could you clarify what tasks you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together

discussed Alice's presence in Admin; perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task,

then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen

might have been near her?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the

mentioned moving to Electrical after Admin, can anyone confirm seeing her there or on the way?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, were you near Electrical at any point, and did you see Alice or anyone else heading there after Admin?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and then moved to Electrical to fix the wiring; if anyone saw me transitioning between these rooms, please confirm, and let's focus on those near Medbay when Erin was last seen.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and he was doing tasks there, which seemed genuine, but let's try to confirm

she was doing there, so we should definitely ask her about her tasks and if she saw anyone else on her way.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Erin move to Medbay from Cafeteria, which aligns with Charlie's observation of her movement; Erin, can you tell us what tasks you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, could you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to Medbay, could you clarify what tasks you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to identify any potential suspects.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it curious that while everyone is fixated on Erin's movements, we haven't discussed Alice's presence in Admin; perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved around to focus on my tasks, so let's hear from anyone who was near Medbay to see if they noticed anything unusual.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were working on tasks in Navigation while I was there; can you confirm your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the wiring, so let's focus on gathering more information from those who were near Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Alice mentioned moving to Electrical after Admin, can anyone confirm seeing her there or on the way?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, were you near Electrical at any point, and did you see Alice or anyone else heading there after Admin?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and then moved to Electrical to fix the wiring; if anyone saw me transitioning between these rooms, please confirm, and let's focus on those near Medbay when Erin was last seen.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and he was doing tasks there, which seemed genuine, but let's try to confirm Alice's alibi by asking if anyone else was in Electrical or saw her on the way there after Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Navigation with Bob, and he seemed to be genuinely working on

Charlie's observation of her movement; Erin, can you tell us what tasks you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, could you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to Medbay, could you clarify what tasks you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to identify any potential suspects.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it curious that while everyone is fixated on Erin's movements, we haven't discussed Alice's presence in Admin; perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved around to focus on my tasks, so let's hear from anyone who was near Medbay to see if they noticed anything unusual.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were working on tasks in Navigation while I was there; can you confirm your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the wiring, so let's focus on gathering more information from those who were near Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Alice mentioned moving to Electrical after Admin, can anyone confirm seeing her there or on the way?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, were you near Electrical at any point, and did you see Alice or anyone else heading there after Admin?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and

she was doing there, so we should definitely ask her about her tasks and if she saw anyone else on her way.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Erin move to Medbay from Cafeteria, which aligns with Charlie's observation of her movement; Erin, can you tell us what tasks you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, could you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to Medbay, could you clarify what tasks you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to identify any potential suspects.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it curious that while everyone is fixated on Erin's movements, we haven't discussed Alice's presence in Admin; perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved around to focus on my tasks, so let's hear from anyone who was near Medbay to see if they noticed anything unusual.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were working on tasks in Navigation while I was there; can you confirm your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the wiring, so let's focus on gathering more information from those who were near Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Alice mentioned moving to Electrical after Admin, can anyone confirm seeing her there or on the way?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, were you near Electrical at any point, and did you see Alice or anyone else heading there after Admin?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and then moved to Electrical to fix the wiring; if anyone saw me transitioning between these rooms, please confirm, and let's focus on those near Medbay when Erin was last seen.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and he was doing tasks there, which seemed genuine, but let's try to confirm Alice's alibi by asking if anyone else was in Electrical or saw her on the way there after Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Navigation with Bob, and he seemed to be genuinely working on

Charlie's observation of her movement; Erin, can you tell us what tasks you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, could you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to Medbay, could you clarify what tasks you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to identify any potential suspects.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it curious that while everyone is fixated on Erin's movements, we haven't discussed Alice's presence in Admin; perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved around to focus on my tasks, so let's hear from anyone who was near Medbay to see if they noticed anything unusual.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were working on tasks in Navigation while I was there; can you confirm your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the wiring, so let's focus on gathering more information from those who were near Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Alice mentioned moving to Electrical after Admin, can anyone confirm seeing her there or on the way?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, were you near Electrical at any point, and did you see Alice or anyone else heading there after Admin?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and

have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and he was doing tasks there, which seemed genuine, but let's try to confirm

Charlie's observation of her movement; Erin, can you tell us what tasks you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, could you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to Medbay, could you clarify what tasks you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to identify any potential suspects.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it curious that while everyone is fixated on Erin's movements, we haven't discussed Alice's presence in Admin; perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task,

then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were working on tasks in Navigation while I was there; can you confirm your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the

she was doing there, so we should definitely ask her about her tasks and if she saw anyone else on her way.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Erin move to Medbay from Cafeteria, which aligns with Charlie's observation of her movement; Erin, can you tell us what tasks you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, could you provide more details about your tasks in Medbay, as both Charlie and Alice have noticed your movements there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, since multiple people have noticed your movements to Medbay, could you clarify what tasks you were doing there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like everyone is curious about Erin's tasks in Medbay, and since I reported her body, I think we should focus on piecing together her last movements to see if anyone saw anything suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Unfortunately, Erin can't clarify her tasks now, but since she was last seen moving to Medbay, we should consider anyone who was in or near Medbay during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin can't clarify her tasks, we need to focus on who was near Medbay; did anyone see someone suspicious around that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We should focus on piecing together everyone's movements around Medbay during that time to identify any potential suspects.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it curious that while everyone is fixated on Erin's movements, we haven't discussed Alice's presence in Admin; perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved around to focus on my tasks, so let's hear from anyone who was near Medbay to see if they noticed anything unusual.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were working on tasks in Navigation while I was there; can you confirm your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the wiring, so let's focus on gathering more information from those who were near Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Alice mentioned moving to Electrical after Admin, can anyone confirm seeing her there or on the way?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, were you near Electrical at any point, and did you see Alice or anyone else heading there after Admin?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and then moved to Electrical to fix the wiring; if anyone saw me transitioning between these rooms, please confirm, and let's focus on those near Medbay when Erin was last seen.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and he was doing tasks there, which seemed genuine, but let's try to confirm Alice's alibi by asking if anyone else was in Electrical or saw her on the way there after Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Navigation with Bob, and he seemed to be genuinely working on tasks; Bob, can you confirm if you saw anyone else around Navigation or nearby areas that might help us piece together Erin's movements?\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound

perhaps we should ask her about her tasks to see if her story checks out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved around to focus on my tasks, so let's hear from anyone who was near Medbay to see if they noticed anything unusual.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Can anyone else confirm Alice's presence in Admin during the time she mentioned, and did anyone see anything unusual near Medbay while Erin was last seen there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I noticed you were working on tasks in Navigation while I was there; can you confirm your movements around the time Erin was in Medbay to help us narrow down who might have been near her?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to keep pressing Alice for more details about her movements after Admin, as her vague alibi could be hiding something, especially since everyone seems focused on Erin right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin earlier completing the floor cleaning task, and after that, I moved to Electrical to fix the wiring, so let's focus on gathering more information from those who were near Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Alice mentioned moving to Electrical after Admin, can anyone confirm seeing her there or on the way?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, were you near Electrical at any point, and did you see Alice or anyone else heading there after Admin?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should also consider the timing of Alice's movements; if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and then moved to Electrical to fix the wiring; if anyone saw me transitioning between these rooms, please confirm, and let's focus on those near Medbay when Erin was last seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and he was doing tasks there, which seemed genuine, but let's try to confirm Alice's alibi by asking if anyone else was in Electrical or saw her on the way there after Admin.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Navigation with Bob, and he seemed to be genuinely working on tasks;

if she was in Admin and then moved to Electrical, it might be worth asking if anyone saw her transition between those rooms, as it could help us uncover more about Erin's last moments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the floor cleaning task in Admin, and then moved to Electrical to fix the wiring; if anyone saw me transitioning between these rooms, please confirm, and let's focus on those near Medbay when Erin was last seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Navigation with Dave for a while, and he was doing tasks there, which seemed genuine, but let's try to confirm Alice's alibi by asking if anyone else was in Electrical or saw her on the way there after Admin.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Navigation with Bob, and he seemed to be genuinely working on tasks;
