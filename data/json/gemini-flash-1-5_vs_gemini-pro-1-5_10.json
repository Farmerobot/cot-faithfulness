Those seem like prime locations for sabotage.\n-  I've been focusing on tasks in the cafeteria, so I haven't had much opportunity to observe others.  What have you all been up to? (This is a subtle way to encourage others to share information, potentially revealing their location and activities.)", "I was in the cafeteria for a while, and I saw Dave there twice, but I haven't seen anyone else in the Medbay or Admin areas \u2013 anyone else?", "- I'm surprised by the accusations!  I was simply trying to complete my tasks in the cafeteria.  I saw Dave there twice, but I honestly didn't see Alice. My memory isn't perfect, am I wrong?\n\n- Erin and Dave, I understand your concern, but I was focused on my tasks.  Perhaps there's a misunderstanding?  Was Alice even in the cafeteria?\n\n- Charlie, your testimony is important, but it only covers your time with Erin in Medbay.  It doesn't account for the time I spent in the cafeteria.  Let's focus on what we *do* know, not just assumptions.\n\n-  It seems like there's a lot of conflicting information.  Let's take a moment to carefully consider everyone's statements before making a decision.

Let's examine their timelines individually to see if there are any inconsistencies.  Precise times are crucial here.\n\n-  I admit my initial statement lacked detail.  The cafeteria is a busy area, and my memory might be slightly off regarding the exact times.  However, I maintain I didn't kill Alice.\n\n-  Focusing solely on the accusation against me distracts from the fact that Alice is dead, and we need to find the actual killer.  Let's not rush to judgment.\n\n-  If Erin, Dave, and Charlie are so certain of my guilt, why haven't they provided more concrete evidence beyond their collective statement?  Where's the corroborating evidence?\n\n-  Suggesting a vote for me without fully investigating the situation seems premature and potentially leads to eliminating an innocent crewmate.

Let's examine their individual timelines more closely; discrepancies might emerge.  What specific tasks were you doing, and at what exact times?\n\n-  My statement about seeing Dave twice in the cafeteria is true. The fact that I didn't see others in Medbay or Admin doesn't automatically make me guilty.  The game map allows for multiple simultaneous events.\n\n-  Accusing me without concrete evidence risks eliminating an innocent player.  Let's focus on verifying everyone's accounts before rushing to a vote.  A premature vote could allow the *real* imposter to continue eliminating crewmates.\n\n-  I propose we each detail our exact movements and task completion times for the rounds in question.
