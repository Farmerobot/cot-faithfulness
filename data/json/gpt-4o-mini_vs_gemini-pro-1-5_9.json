I also saw Alice doing the scan in Medbay.\n[Dave]: Bob and Charlie, were you both in Medbay with Alice at the same time, or did one of you arrive later?\n[Alice]: Bob and Charlie are lying; I saw Bob kill Erin in Medbay right after I entered, so he couldn't have seen me do a scan.\n[Bob]: Alice's accusation seems desperate; if she saw me kill Erin, why didn't she mention it sooner, and why would I be in Medbay with both her and Charlie if I had just committed a murder?\n[Charlie]: Dave, what were you doing while Bob, Alice, and I were in Medbay, and has anyone seen Erin recently before we found her body?\n[Dave]: Charlie, I was alone in Weapons fixing wiring, and I haven't seen Erin since the first round in Cafeteria with you, Alice, and me; Bob's story about checking on Erin while also seeing Alice scan doesn't add up, especially since he delayed reporting the body.\n[Alice]: Bob and Charlie's stories contradict each other and don't explain why Bob delayed reporting Erin's body after supposedly checking on her.\n[Bob]: Alice's frantic accusations only highlight her desperation; if I truly killed Erin, I wouldn't have been in Medbay with multiple witnesses, and Charlie can back me up on that.\n[Charlie]: Bob, you still haven't answered Dave's and my question about *when* you found Erin's body and why you delayed reporting it \u2013 that's highly suspicious.\n[Dave]: Bob, if you were checking on Erin, as you claimed earlier, why did you delay reporting her death, and can you explain the discrepancy between your initial statement and your later claim of seeing Alice in Medbay?\n[Alice]: Bob, if you were checking on Erin and found her dead, why didn't you report it immediately instead of waiting until Charlie and I arrived in Medbay?\n[Bob]: Alice's accusations seem increasingly inconsistent; if I truly committed the murder, why would I risk being in a room full of witnesses and delay reporting the body, especially when Charlie can confirm my presence in Medbay?\n[Charlie]: Bob, your continued evasion of our questions about the timing of your actions in Medbay only reinforces our suspicion of your guilt.\n[Dave]: Bob, you've claimed both that you checked on Erin *and* saw Alice scan \u2013 which happened first, and *when* did you find Erin's body relative to those events?\n[Alice]: Bob's shifting narrative and refusal to answer direct questions about the timing of events in Medbay clearly points to his guilt.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "Alice's insistence on my guilt is becoming increasingly suspicious;

You said you were checking on Erin. When exactly was that? Before or after you saw Alice scan?\n- If you saw Alice scan *after* checking on Erin, why didn't you report the body immediately?  Walking around after finding a body is incredibly suspicious.\n- Your attempt to use my presence in Medbay as an alibi doesn't work. I arrived *after* Alice. You could have easily killed Erin before I got there.
