However, if anyone was near Medbay or Weapons, their insights could be valuable.\n- Let's focus on clarifying who reported Charlie's body and where it was found, as this will help us accurately piece together everyone's movements and identify any inconsistencies.\n- Dave and Bob both mentioned tasks in the Cafeteria. Maybe we should confirm if anyone else was there to verify their activities and ensure no one went unnoticed.\n- Erin, could you clarify if you had any specific tasks in Weapons or if you were just checking for tasks? This might help us understand your movements better.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I'd like to hear from Erin about what she was doing in the Weapons room, it seems like an unusual place to be when we have tasks to complete in other rooms.\n[Bob]: I saw Erin move to Weapons from the Cafeteria after doing a task here, so it might be worth hearing what tasks she had in Weapons.\n[Erin]: I moved to Weapons after completing my task in the Cafeteria to check for tasks I could help with there, but I didn't see anyone else, which is why I have no additional observations.\n[Alice]: I was in Medbay this whole time working on a scan task, but I agree we should focus on covering all rooms efficiently and maybe check if anyone else was near Weapons to gather more information.\n[Dave]: Considering Erin's lack of additional observations in the Weapons room, and Bob's confirmation that she moved there from the Cafeteria, I think it's even more crucial that we investigate her alibi further and consider the possibility that she might be hiding something.\n[Bob]: We should also consider the possibility that someone else might have moved through Weapons unnoticed, so let's gather more information from others who might have been nearby.\n[Erin]: Dave, I noticed you stayed in the Cafeteria while others were completing tasks; could you explain what you were doing during that time?\n[Alice]: Alice: Bob, since you reported the body, can you tell us exactly where you found Charlie? Knowing the location might help us determine who could have been nearby.\n[Dave]: I'd like to address Erin's question about my activities in the Cafeteria, I was simply focusing on emptying the cafeteria trash, a task that needed to be done, and I didn't see anything suspicious while I was there.\n[Bob]: I didn't report any body, so I'm not sure why Alice mentioned that; perhaps there's some confusion here, and we should clarify who actually reported Charlie.\n[Erin]: Bob, since you mentioned seeing me move to Weapons, did you notice anyone else moving in or out of Cafeteria after I left?
