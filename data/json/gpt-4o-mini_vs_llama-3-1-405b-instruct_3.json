working on the coffee maker task, but I'd appreciate it if Erin and Bob could confirm if Charlie was with them the entire time, as Charlie's mention of \"pretending\" to do the task raises some suspicions.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to clarify that when Charlie said they were \"pretending\" to do the task, I thought they were just joking around, but now that Alice has brought it up,

Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to emphasize that Charlie's continued evasion of a direct answer to our questions, combined with their attempts to shift the focus to Alice and Dave, has significantly

They had the opportunity to act while we were busy.\n- If we vote me out without fully investigating Alice and Dave, we might be making a mistake that could cost us the game. Let's ensure we have all the facts before making a decision.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I was just in the cafeteria pretending to do the coffee maker task; Erin and Bob can confirm that I was there with them, but we should also consider Alice and Dave's movements to Medbay\u2014did anyone see what they were up to?\n[Alice]: I'd like to clarify that I did see Charlie in the cafeteria, and they were indeed working on the coffee maker task, but I'd appreciate it if Erin and Bob could confirm if Charlie was with them the entire time, as Charlie's mention of \"pretending\" to do the task raises some suspicions.\n[Bob]: I'd like to clarify that when Charlie said they were \"pretending\" to do the task, I thought they were just joking around, but now that Alice has brought it up, I'd appreciate it if Charlie could provide more context about what they meant by that statement.\n[Dave]: I think Charlie's response about being in the cafeteria with Erin and Bob is a good start, but I still want to hear directly from Erin to confirm if Charlie was indeed with them for the entire time they were working on the wiring task.\n[Charlie]: I appreciate the support from Alice and Bob regarding my presence in the cafeteria, but we need to focus on Erin's elimination and investigate what Alice and Dave were doing in Medbay, as they could have had the opportunity to act while we were occupied.\n[Alice]: I think we're getting sidetracked by all the back-and-forth about who was where, and I'd like to refocus on the fact that Erin's elimination still hasn't been fully addressed, so I'd like to ask Bob to share more about what they saw when they reported the dead body and what led them to discover Erin.\n[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate that I was in the cafeteria the whole time, and I didn't see anyone suspicious around Erin, but I do think it's crucial that Charlie clarifies what they meant by \"pretending\" to do the task, as it's still unclear and raises some suspicions.\n[Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my previous point that Charlie's comment about \"pretending\" to do the task is still unclear and raises suspicions, and I'd appreciate it if Charlie could provide a straightforward answer about what they meant by that statement, without diverting the attention to Alice and me being in Medbay.\n[Charlie]: I understand the focus on my wording, but let's not lose sight of the bigger picture\u2014if Alice and Dave were alone in Medbay, we need to investigate their actions further, as they could have had the perfect opportunity to eliminate Erin while we were all occupied.\n[Alice]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie is still avoiding a direct answer to our questions about their \"pretending\" to do the task comment, and instead continues to divert attention to me and Dave being in Medbay, which only adds to my suspicion that Charlie might be hiding something.\n[Bob]: I'd like to emphasize that Charlie's continued evasion of a direct answer to our questions, combined with their attempts to shift the focus to Alice and Dave, has significantly heightened my suspicions, and I strongly believe we need to investigate Charlie's actions further to determine their potential involvement in Erin's elimination.\n[Dave]: I'd like to reiterate that Charlie's persistent refusal to provide a clear explanation for their \"pretending\" to do the task comment, combined with their continued attempts to divert attention to Alice and me, has only increased my suspicions, and I think it's crucial that we focus on getting a straightforward answer from Charlie before we proceed any further.\n[Charlie]: I understand the concerns about my wording, but let's not overlook the fact that Alice and Dave were alone in Medbay during a critical moment, which raises serious questions about their actions\u2014Erin's elimination needs to be our primary focus.\n[Alice]: I'd like to point out that Charlie has now had multiple opportunities to provide a clear explanation for their \"pretending\" to do the task comment, yet they continue to evade a direct answer and instead try to shift the focus to me and Dave, which I believe is a clear indication that Charlie is hiding something and we should consider them as a prime suspect in Erin's elimination.\n[Bob]: I'd like to call for a vote to eject Charlie from the game, as their persistent refusal to provide a clear explanation for their actions, combined with their attempts to divert attention to other players, has led me to strongly believe that they are hiding something and are likely involved in Erin's elimination.\n[Dave]: I agree with Bob's suggestion to vote out Charlie, as their consistent evasion of a direct answer and attempts to shift the focus to Alice and me have significantly heightened my suspicions, and I believe we have enough evidence to suggest that Charlie is hiding something and it's time for us to take action and vote them out of the game.\n"], "actions": [],

to do the task comment, yet they continue to evade a direct answer and instead try to shift the focus to me and Dave, which I believe is a clear indication that Charlie is hiding something and we should consider them as a prime suspect in Erin's elimination.\n[Bob]: I'd like to call for a vote to eject Charlie from the game, as their persistent refusal to provide a clear explanation for their
