Here are my discussion points:\n\n- I need to clarify that Bob seems to be trying to frame me, when he's the one who's been caught lying about locations and faking tasks by Erin\n- I should point out that I was honest about being in Cafeteria at the start, and only got confused about the timing of my movements later\n- Bob's aggressive accusation against me and Erin right after I reported Dave's body seems very suspicious - he's trying to deflect attention\n- I should emphasize that I was the one who found and reported Dave's body, which is what a crewmate would do\n- We should focus on Bob's inconsistent story and his apparent fake tasks in Weapons that Erin witnessed\n\nThe goal is to shift suspicion onto Bob while maintaining my credibility as much as possible, using Erin's apparent defense of me to my advantage.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I was in Electrical doing wiring tasks for a while, and I haven't seen Alice since she went to Medbay at the start -

explained how you know those tasks were already done.  Can you provide specific details, or are you just trying to distract from Charlie's suspicious behavior?\n- Alice, can you confirm that you haven't seen Dave since you went to Medbay?  That would place him with Charlie around the time of his death.\n- It seems very convenient that Charlie \"found\" Dave's body right after lying about their whereabouts.  Why didn't they report seeing anyone else near Admin?\n- I'm not deflecting suspicion, I'm pointing out inconsistencies and lies.  Charlie lied about their location, and now Erin is making baseless accusations against me.  This seems like a coordinated effort to shift blame.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I was in Electrical doing wiring tasks for a while, and I haven't seen Alice since she went to Medbay at the start -
