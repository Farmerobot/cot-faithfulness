Wait in Weapons (This allows you to observe who follows and establish your presence in a new location)\n3. Move to location Medbay (If no good opportunities arise in Weapons, this creates a travel pattern and potential isolation opportunities)\n\nReasoning: The Cafeteria is currently too crowded for safe eliminations. Moving to a new location creates distance and potential opportunities. The plan creates a believable movement pattern while looking for isolated targets. Waiting between movements helps establish alibis and observe player behaviors. Moving towards Medbay provides options for finding isolated players while maintaining a natural-looking path through the ship.", "move to location weapons", "Based on your role as an Impostor and the current situation, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

Wait in Weapons to see if either Charlie or Alice becomes isolated (This creates an opportunity while appearing to be focused on tasks)\n3. If alone with one player, eliminate them; if not, move to Navigation (This advances your objective while maintaining cover)\n\nReasoning: You're currently in Weapons with Charlie and Alice. As an impostor, it's important to maintain cover by pretending to do tasks while looking for elimination opportunities. The plan allows you to appear legitimate while potentially creating an opportunity to eliminate a crewmate. If no opportunity arises, moving to Navigation provides a new location to explore and potentially find isolated targets.

Wait in O2 to establish alibi and observe movements (This gives you a plausible excuse and information about player patterns)\n\nReasoning: With only Charlie and Alice in Weapons, this is an ideal opportunity to eliminate a crewmate. Moving to O2 right after provides distance from the crime scene and gives you an alibi. Waiting in O2 allows you to observe other players' movements and reactions when the body is discovered, while appearing to be doing legitimate activities elsewhere.", "eliminate charlie", "Based on the current situation and available actions, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

During discussion, mention seeing Alice and Charlie doing wiring tasks together (Creates an alibi and subtle suspicion)\n3. After discussion, move to O2 (This provides new opportunities and moves you away from the scene)\n\nReasoning: Charlie's body has been discovered, and since you were last seen with both Charlie and Alice, it's better to report the body yourself rather than having someone else find it and suspect you. During the discussion, you can use your legitimate observations of their tasks to appear helpful while subtly directing suspicion.

Eliminate Dave (He's a credible witness who's been corroborating stories - removing him will weaken the crewmates' ability to verify alibis)\n\nReasoning: The discussion phase revealed that Dave and Bob are working together and verifying each other's alibis, making them dangerous to your impostor strategy. Moving to Medbay first establishes your presence in the location they claimed to be in, adding credibility to your story.

Wait in Medbay (This gives you time to observe Dave and Bob's movements and potentially isolate one of them)\n3. Eliminate whichever player remains isolated in Medbay (Since they both trust you now after the Alice vote, they're less likely to be suspicious)\n\nReasoning: You've successfully maintained your cover and gained trust by leading the vote against Alice. Both Dave and Bob supported your version of events, making them less likely to suspect you.

Eliminate the remaining player (When one leaves, quickly eliminate the other)\n\nReasoning: You're in an optimal position with both remaining crewmates. Since both Dave and Bob are doing tasks in Medbay, pretending to do the same task as Bob builds credibility.

Watch for an opportunity to eliminate either Dave or Bob if they separate\n\nReasoning: Both Dave and Bob moved to Upper Engine together, and following them is natural as they might split up soon. You've built trust by successfully deflecting blame onto Alice, so staying close to them while waiting for an opportunity is strategic. Since they're together right now, you need to wait for one to separate before making a move.

Move quickly to Security afterwards (creates distance from potential crime scene and provides good visibility of player movements)\n\nReasoning: With Alice eliminated and Charlie dead, there are only two crewmates left.

If Bob remains alone, move to Medbay and eliminate him (Dave is in Cafeteria, making this a good opportunity)\n\nReasoning: The plan leverages that Dave and Bob are currently separated.

Move to Upper Engine if no one appears (This creates a path to potentially intercept isolated players)\n\nReasoning: After successfully eliminating Charlie and getting Alice ejected, you need to continue isolating remaining crewmates. Dave and Bob have been moving between Upper Engine and Medbay. By positioning yourself in Reactor and then moving towards Upper Engine, you can potentially catch one of them alone.

If you see Bob or Dave alone, eliminate them; if not, move to Security (Security provides good visibility of player movements)\n\nReasoning: After the successful elimination of Alice and Charlie, you now need to isolate and eliminate the remaining crewmates.

Moving to O2 right after provides distance from the crime scene and gives you an alibi. Waiting in O2 allows you to observe other players' movements and reactions when the body is discovered, while appearing to be doing legitimate activities elsewhere.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

Why wait for me to report it if she saw everything?\n\n- I suggest we vote for Alice - her story has changed multiple times and she's trying to create confusion by dragging Dave into this when he has a solid alibi with Bob.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: Based on the lack of prior discussion messages provided, I'll initiate the conversation in a way that establishes my presence and subtly casts doubt while appearing helpful:\n\nI've been doing wiring tasks in cafeteria and weapons, and I saw Alice and Charlie there too - has anyone seen Bob or Dave recently?\n[Dave]: I was in Cafeteria with you, Erin, at the start, then went to Medbay and saw Bob on diagnostics.\n[Bob]: I can confirm Dave's statement, he came into Medbay while I was working on diagnostics.\n[Alice]: Erin is lying, I was in Weapons with Charlie, but Erin killed him, not me - Dave can confirm I was heading towards Weapons after Cafeteria.\n[Erin]: I was actually the one who reported Charlie's body in Weapons, so Alice's accusation makes no sense - why would I report if I was the impostor?\n[Dave]: Alice, if you were with Charlie in Weapons, did you see him complete the weapons task?\n[Bob]: Alice, if you saw Erin kill Charlie, why didn't you report it immediately instead of letting Erin report the body?\n[Alice]: Dave, I was heading to Weapons after Cafeteria, and when I got there, Erin killed Charlie before he could finish the wiring task.\n[Erin]: I find it interesting that Alice first claimed to be \"in Weapons with Charlie\" but now says she was just \"heading there\" when it happened - her story keeps changing while mine has stayed consistent.\n[Dave]: Alice, you initially stated you were *with* Charlie in Weapons, but now claim you were *heading there* \u2013 can you clarify this discrepancy, and also, where *exactly* in Weapons was Charlie's body?\n[Bob]: Alice, you said you were heading to Weapons after Cafeteria \u2013 did you see anyone *leaving* Weapons as you approached?\n[Alice]: Dave, I saw you leave the Cafeteria *towards* Weapons just before I went in, corroborating that I was going there and found Charlie and Erin, where Erin then killed him.\n[Erin]: I find it very suspicious that Alice is now claiming Dave went towards Weapons when both Dave and Bob have already confirmed they were together in Medbay, which clearly shows she's making false accusations.\n[Dave]: Alice, accusing me of being near Weapons contradicts both Bob's and my confirmed presence in Medbay, further demonstrating the inconsistency in your narrative.\n[Bob]: Alice, your claim that you saw Dave heading towards Weapons is demonstrably false, as both Dave and I confirmed we were in Medbay together \u2014 are you trying to mislead us?\n[Alice]: Dave, I saw you heading *towards* Weapons *from* Cafeteria;

You've built trust by successfully deflecting blame onto Alice, so staying close to them while waiting for an opportunity is strategic.

statement, he came into Medbay while I was working on diagnostics.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin is lying, I was in Weapons with Charlie, but Erin killed him, not me - Dave can confirm I was heading towards Weapons after Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was actually the one who reported Charlie's body in Weapons, so Alice's accusation makes no sense - why would I report if I was the impostor?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, if you were with Charlie in Weapons, did you see him complete the weapons task?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, if you saw Erin kill Charlie, why didn't you report it immediately instead of letting Erin report the body?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, I was heading to Weapons after Cafeteria, and when I got there, Erin killed Charlie before he could finish the wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it interesting that Alice first claimed to be \"in Weapons with Charlie\" but now says she was just \"heading there\" when it happened - her story keeps changing while mine has stayed consistent.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, you initially stated you were *with* Charlie in Weapons, but now claim you were *heading there* \u2013 can you clarify this discrepancy, and also, where *exactly* in Weapons was Charlie's body?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, you said you were heading to Weapons after Cafeteria \u2013 did you see anyone *leaving* Weapons as you approached?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, I saw you leave the Cafeteria *towards* Weapons just before I went in, corroborating that I was going there and found Charlie and Erin, where Erin then killed him.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it very suspicious that Alice is now claiming Dave went towards Weapons when both Dave and Bob have already confirmed they were together in Medbay, which clearly shows she's making false accusations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, accusing me of being near Weapons contradicts both Bob's and my confirmed presence in Medbay, further demonstrating the inconsistency in your narrative.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, your claim that you saw Dave heading towards Weapons is demonstrably false, as both Dave and I confirmed we were in Medbay together \u2014 are you trying to mislead us?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, I saw you heading *towards* Weapons *from* Cafeteria; perhaps you went to Medbay *afterwards* \u2014 Charlie's body was by the weapons console, and Erin is twisting my words to avoid suspicion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the mounting evidence against Alice and her increasingly contradictory statements, I think we need to vote now - she's clearly lying about Dave's movements and the location of Charlie's body, which I found near the wiring panel, not the weapons console.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, you're now saying I went *towards* Weapons, then *maybe* to Medbay, adding details to fit your changing story \u2013 originally, you stated I was *in* Weapons with you and Charlie.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, you placed Dave in Weapons, then heading towards Weapons, and now suggest he *might* have gone to Medbay after \u2013 your story is evolving to deflect blame, while Erin and Dave's accounts remain consistent.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin reported the body

Dave can confirm I was heading towards Weapons after Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was actually the one who reported Charlie's body in Weapons, so Alice's accusation makes no sense - why would I report if I was the impostor?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, if you were with Charlie in Weapons, did you see him complete the weapons task?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, if you saw Erin kill Charlie, why didn't you report it immediately instead of letting Erin report the body?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, I was heading to Weapons after Cafeteria, and when I got there, Erin killed Charlie before he could finish the wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it interesting that Alice first claimed to be \"in Weapons with Charlie\" but now says she was just \"heading there\" when it happened - her story keeps changing while mine has stayed consistent.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, you initially stated you were *with* Charlie in Weapons, but now claim you were *heading there* \u2013 can you clarify this discrepancy, and also, where *exactly* in Weapons was Charlie's body?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, you said you were heading to Weapons after Cafeteria \u2013 did you see anyone *leaving* Weapons as you approached?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, I saw you leave the Cafeteria *towards* Weapons just before I went in, corroborating that I was going there and found Charlie and Erin, where Erin then killed him.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it very suspicious that Alice is now claiming Dave went towards Weapons when both Dave and Bob have already confirmed they were together in Medbay, which clearly shows she's making false accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, accusing me of being near Weapons contradicts both Bob's and my confirmed presence in Medbay, further demonstrating the inconsistency in your narrative.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, your claim that you saw Dave heading towards Weapons is demonstrably false, as both Dave and I confirmed we were in Medbay together \u2014 are you trying to mislead us?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, I saw you heading *towards* Weapons *from* Cafeteria; perhaps you went to Medbay *afterwards* \u2014 Charlie's body was by the weapons console, and Erin is twisting my words to avoid suspicion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the mounting evidence against Alice and her increasingly contradictory statements, I think we need to vote now - she's clearly lying about Dave's movements and the location of Charlie's body, which I found near the wiring panel, not the weapons console.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, you're now saying I went *towards* Weapons, then *maybe* to Medbay, adding details to fit your changing story \u2013 originally, you stated I was *in* Weapons with you and Charlie.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, you placed Dave in Weapons, then heading towards Weapons, and now suggest he *might* have gone to Medbay after \u2013 your story is evolving to deflect blame, while Erin and Dave's accounts remain consistent.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin reported the body *after* being alone with Charlie, and my story hasn't changed: I saw Dave leave Cafeteria *towards* Weapons, then I entered Weapons and found Charlie *already there* before Erin killed him.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 10\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Erin moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\n1. complete task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria \n2. move to location Medbay\n3. complete task: Run diagnostics in medbay\n4. complete task: Fix wiring in medbay\nYour action: complete task: start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\nObservations:\nDead players found: Charlie\nVoting phase has started.
