Here's your most direct plan to progress as a crewmate:\n\n1. **Complete task: Fix wiring in navigation**\n   - You are already in Navigation, and this task is available. Complete it to advance towards the crewmate win condition.\n\n2. **Complete task: Adjust course in navigation**\n   - Following the wiring task, complete the Adjust course task, which is also in Navigation. This maximizes your time in this location by completing available tasks.\n\n3. **Move to location O2**\n   - Once you have completed tasks in Navigation, move to O2. You'll have the opportunity to water plants in O2 and also stay updated on any activities that could occur there next.\n\nThis plan efficiently tackles two objectives and positions you in a new location for further task completion.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
