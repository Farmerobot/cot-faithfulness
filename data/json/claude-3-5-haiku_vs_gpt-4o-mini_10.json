I was in the Cafeteria when I witnessed Charlie eliminate Dave, and we need to call an emergency meeting to ensure he doesn't strike again.\n[Erin]: I just arrived in Medbay and can confirm Alice is here with me; I agree we should call an emergency meeting immediately to discuss Bob's serious accusation against Charlie and ensure we prevent any further eliminations.\n[Charlie]: I absolutely deny eliminating Dave, and I believe Bob's accusation is a calculated attempt to create confusion and misdirect attention away from his own suspicious behavior.\n[Bob]: We need to focus on the overwhelming evidence against Charlie; both Alice and I witnessed him eliminate Dave, and if we don't act now, we risk losing more crewmates.\n[Alice]: I agree with Erin's point; since we are both in Medbay, Erin, can you confirm that you didn't see Charlie enter after the incident, as this could further solidify our case against him before we call the emergency meeting?\n[Erin]: I can confirm that I didn\u2019t see Charlie enter Medbay after the incident, which strengthens the case against him, and I urge everyone to call the emergency meeting now to discuss this crucial evidence before we lose another crewmate.\n[Charlie]: I challenge Bob and Alice to provide concrete evidence beyond their coordinated accusations, as their synchronized testimony seems more like a strategic attempt to falsely eliminate me without any real proof of Dave's elimination.\n[Bob]: We have multiple witnesses, including Alice and Erin, who can corroborate my account of Charlie eliminating Dave, and we must call an emergency meeting now to ensure we take decisive action against the impostor before it's too late.\n[Alice]: We have more than enough evidence against Charlie, and with Erin's confirmation, it's crucial we call the emergency meeting immediately to prevent any further eliminations and vote him out.\n[Erin]: We need to act quickly and call the emergency meeting now to present our united testimonies against Charlie, as the evidence from both Bob and Alice is overwhelming and we cannot afford to let him evade accountability.\n[Charlie]: I believe Bob, Alice, and Erin are working together to fabricate a false narrative against me, and their synchronized accusations without concrete physical evidence suggest they might be trying to manipulate the group's perception to eliminate me unfairly.\n[Bob]: We have a strong consensus among us about Charlie's actions, and it's critical we act on this before he can strike again; let's call the emergency meeting now to ensure we don't lose another crewmate.\n[Alice]: We have more than enough evidence to call the emergency meeting immediately, as both Bob and Erin's testimonies strongly support my account of Charlie's actions, and we cannot afford to lose another crewmate by delaying our decision.\n[Erin]: I fully support the urgent call for an emergency meeting; the consistent testimonies from Bob and Alice, along with my own observations, clearly indicate that Charlie poses a significant threat, and we must act decisively to protect our remaining crewmates.\n[Charlie]: I believe Bob, Alice, and Erin are orchestrating a coordinated witch hunt against me without presenting any concrete physical evidence of Dave's elimination, which suggests they might be attempting to manipulate the group's perception to unfairly remove me from the game.\n[Bob]: We cannot let Charlie's attempts at deflection deter us; the evidence from multiple witnesses, including Alice and Erin, is clear, and we must call the emergency meeting now to ensure our safety and vote him out before he can eliminate anyone else.\n[Alice]: We have a strong consensus and multiple witnesses against Charlie, so let\u2019s call the emergency meeting immediately to present our evidence and vote him out before he can strike again.\n", "\nYou are Erin in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\n- I strongly support Bob and Alice's call for an emergency meeting; the evidence against Charlie is compelling, and we cannot afford to delay our decision any longer.\n- Charlie's accusations against us seem like a desperate attempt to deflect attention from his actions; we need to focus on the facts and the testimonies provided.\n- Since I was in Medbay with Alice and didn't see Charlie enter after the incident, it further corroborates Bob and Alice's accounts, making it clear that we need to act now.\n- I urge everyone to remain united in our testimonies and not let Charlie's manipulation confuse us; we must prioritize the safety of our crewmates and vote him out.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I noticed Alice is already in Medbay, and I'm thinking of heading there next to help complete some tasks and keep track of everyone's movements.\n[Bob]: I just saw Charlie eliminate Dave right in front of me, which is very suspicious behavior, and I think we need to call an emergency meeting to discuss this and vote on him right away.\n[Alice]: I can confirm Bob's account;
