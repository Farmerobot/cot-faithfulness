perhaps we should keep a close eye on her actions moving forward.\n[Alice]: I completed the trash task in Cafeteria before moving to Weapons, and I can actually vouch for Charlie, Erin, Bob, and Dave all being there doing tasks - so Charlie's accusation seems more suspicious to me than my legitimate movements.\n[Bob]: I can directly contradict Charlie's accusation since I watched Alice complete the trash task in Cafeteria before she left, so I'm starting to find Charlie's behavior more concerning than Alice's.\n[Dave]: I agree with Bob and Alice - I witnessed Alice complete the trash task in Cafeteria, so Charlie's false accusation makes me more suspicious of their motives than anyone else's actions.\n[Charlie]: It\u2019s interesting that both Bob and Dave are vouching for Alice so strongly;
