suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Alice; Bob has been moving around a lot, and I noticed he was in Weapons when I was there too, which made it seem like he was just pretending to do tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I just completed the trash task in Cafeteria, and I can confirm I saw both Alice and Dave doing wiring there, which makes their accusations against Bob seem a bit suspicious to me.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it curious that Alice and Dave are so quick to point fingers at Bob when they have confirmed alibis from Erin; we should really analyze everyone's movements and tasks more closely before making any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should be more suspicious of Charlie's defense of Bob, especially since I saw Bob faking tasks in Weapons before following me to Electrical.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I believe we should focus on Bob's movements; he was unaccounted for when the body was found, and his behavior in Weapons and Electrical raises significant concerns that we can't ignore.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I understand the concerns about Bob's movements, but we should also consider that Alice and Dave may be trying to divert our attention from their own actions, especially since they were together in the Cafeteria during the time of the alleged faking.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I appreciate Erin's observations about Alice and Dave; their quickness to accuse Bob while having a solid alibi raises red flags about their intentions, and we should carefully examine their movements as well.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The fact that Charlie and Erin are so quick to defend Bob despite his suspicious behavior in Weapons and Electrical makes me wonder if they're trying to protect a fellow impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob's movements have been highly suspicious, especially being alone in both Weapons and Electrical without anyone to back up his story, which is a significant red flag we cannot ignore.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: It's clear that Alice and Dave are trying to shift the focus onto Bob while their own movements may warrant closer scrutiny; we should not overlook the potential for them to be working together to mislead us.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we need to focus on the fact that both Alice and Dave are pushing hard against Bob while conveniently having each other's backs, which raises the possibility that they might be trying to mislead us to protect themselves.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The fact that Erin and Charlie keep trying to discredit my valid observations about Bob's movements between Weapons and Electrical, despite Dave independently confirming them, makes their defense of Bob even more suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I find it concerning that Erin and Charlie are so eager to defend Bob while dismissing the clear patterns in his movements, which not only lack alibis but also coincide with the timing of the body being found.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we should all take a step back and reevaluate the situation, as Alice and Dave's insistence on Bob without solid evidence seems more like a coordinated effort to distract us from their own actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I

concerning that Erin and Charlie are so eager to defend Bob while ignoring the fact that he was alone in Weapons and Electrical, which raises significant red flags about his behavior.\n- Bob's movements have been inconsistent, and I believe we need to keep our focus on him rather than allowing Erin and Charlie to divert our attention away from the real issue at hand.\n- Erin claims to have confirmed alibis for both Alice and me, but we were also in the Cafeteria together when Bob was unaccounted for, which makes her statements questionable.\n- Charlie's defense of Bob seems to stem from a desire to protect him rather than genuinely analyzing the situation, which further supports the idea that we should be more suspicious of Bob's actions.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: Based on

raises the possibility that they might be trying to mislead us to protect themselves.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: The fact that Erin and Charlie keep trying to discredit my valid observations about Bob's movements between Weapons and Electrical, despite Dave independently confirming them, makes their defense of Bob even more suspicious.", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I find it concerning that Erin
