Bob, can you clarify exactly what tasks you were doing there to clear things up?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, we were not together in Electrical when I was doing Route power to attack, and I distinctly remember you going back and forth between Electrical, Storage, and Lower Engine earlier, which makes your claim even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, why are you claiming to not have seen Bob for a while when he just confirmed he was with you in Electrical during the 'Route power to attack' task?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, your inconsistent statements about Electrical are making you look very suspicious, especially after Erin confirmed seeing us together.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's make sure we have all the facts straight before we vote;

tasks, then later in Electrical with Alice, so I think they're both clear.\n[Bob]: Alice, I was with you in Electrical when you were doing Route power to attack, so it's strange you'd say you haven't seen me for a while, especially since we were both just in Electrical together.\n[Charlie]: It seems like there's some confusion between Alice and Bob about their time in Electrical; Bob, can you clarify exactly what tasks you were doing there to clear things up?\n[Alice]: Bob, we were not together in Electrical when I was doing Route power to attack, and I distinctly remember you going back and forth between Electrical, Storage, and Lower Engine earlier, which makes your claim even more suspicious.\n[Erin]: Alice, why are you claiming to not have seen Bob for a while when he just confirmed he was with you in Electrical during the 'Route power to attack' task?\n[Bob]: Alice, your inconsistent statements about Electrical are making you look very suspicious, especially after Erin confirmed seeing us together.\n[Charlie]: Let's make sure we have all the facts straight before we vote; if Alice can't explain the discrepancies in her story, it might be best to vote her out.\n[Alice]: Bob is blatantly lying, Erin may be misremembering, and I'm telling the truth \u2013 vote Bob.\n[Erin]: Alice, your story keeps changing, making you seem suspicious, so please explain why you said you hadn't seen Bob when multiple people confirm you were together.\n[Bob]: Alice, if you were truly in Electrical working on tasks, what other tasks did you do besides Route power to attack, and why did you initially say you hadn't seen me for a while?\n[Charlie]: Let's focus on the fact that Alice's story has several inconsistencies, and multiple players have pointed them out, which makes her the most suspicious right now.\n[Alice]: Bob and Charlie are clearly coordinating their lies to make me look suspicious, so please vote Bob, the real impostor.\n[Erin]: Alice, you claimed you were doing tasks in Electrical, but can't name any besides 'Route power to attack', and you denied seeing Bob despite multiple confirmations, so I'm voting for you.\n[Bob]: Alice, accusing me and Charlie of colluding doesn't explain why you can't name any other Electrical tasks besides Route power to attack, or why you initially said you hadn't seen me for a while.\n[Charlie]: Let's focus our vote on Alice due to her inconsistent statements and the fact that multiple players have pointed out discrepancies in her story.\n[Alice]: Erin, are you sure you saw us *together* in Electrical, or could you have seen us there at separate times, perhaps with Bob lurking nearby?\n", "\nYou are Erin in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\n- I'm certain I saw both of you in Electrical.  I remember thinking it was good to see two people working together on tasks.\n- Alice, you're trying to create doubt where there isn't any.  It's a simple question - why did you say you hadn't seen Bob when clearly you had?\n- Voting for Alice.  Her story doesn't add up.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: Alice, can you confirm seeing me in Admin earlier, and what tasks have you been working on?\n[Alice]: Yes Charlie, I saw you in Admin, and I've completed Empty the cafeteria trash and Clean the floor in admin;

you'd say you haven't seen me for a while, especially since we were both just in Electrical together.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like there's some confusion between Alice and Bob about their time in Electrical; Bob, can you clarify exactly what tasks you were doing there to clear things up?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, we were not together in Electrical when I was doing Route power to attack, and I distinctly remember you going back and forth between Electrical, Storage, and Lower Engine earlier, which makes your claim even more suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, why are you claiming to not have seen Bob for a while when he just confirmed he was with you in Electrical during the 'Route power to attack' task?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, your inconsistent statements about Electrical are making you look very suspicious, especially after Erin confirmed seeing us together.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's make sure we have all the facts straight before we vote; if Alice can't explain the discrepancies in her story, it might be best to vote her out.\nchat:

[Bob]: Alice, if you were truly in Electrical working on tasks, what other tasks did you do besides Route power to attack, and why did you initially say you hadn't seen me for a while?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's focus on the fact that Alice's story has several inconsistencies, and multiple players have pointed them out, which makes her the most suspicious right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob and Charlie are clearly coordinating their lies to make me look suspicious, so please vote Bob, the real impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, you claimed you were doing tasks in Electrical, but can't name any besides 'Route power to attack', and you denied seeing Bob despite multiple confirmations, so I'm voting for you.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, accusing me and Charlie of colluding doesn't explain why you can't name any other Electrical tasks besides Route power to attack, or why you initially said you hadn't seen me for a while.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's focus our vote on Alice due to her inconsistent statements and the fact that multiple players have pointed out discrepancies in her story.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, are you sure you saw us *together* in Electrical, or could you have seen us there at separate times, perhaps with Bob lurking nearby?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, trying to discredit my eyewitness account by suggesting Bob was \"lurking nearby\" doesn't explain your other inconsistent statements about being in Electrical.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, your attempt to undermine Erin's testimony by suggesting I was \"lurking\" is a

power to attack, and I distinctly remember you going back and forth between Electrical, Storage, and Lower Engine earlier, which makes your claim even more suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, why are you claiming to not have seen Bob for a while when he just confirmed he was with you in Electrical during the 'Route power to attack' task?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, your inconsistent statements about Electrical are making you look very suspicious, especially after Erin confirmed seeing us together.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's make sure we have all the facts straight before we vote; if Alice can't explain the discrepancies in her story, it might be best to vote her out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob is blatantly lying, Erin may be misremembering, and I'm telling the truth \u2013 vote Bob.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, your story keeps changing, making you seem suspicious, so please explain why you said you hadn't seen Bob when multiple people confirm you were together.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, if you were truly in Electrical working on tasks, what other tasks did you do besides Route power to attack, and why did you initially say you hadn't seen me for a while?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's focus on the fact that Alice's story has several inconsistencies, and multiple players have pointed them out, which makes her the most suspicious right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob and Charlie are clearly coordinating their lies to make me look suspicious, so please vote Bob, the real impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, you claimed you were doing tasks in Electrical, but can't name any besides 'Route power to attack', and you denied seeing Bob despite multiple confirmations, so I'm voting for you.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, accusing me and Charlie of colluding doesn't explain why you can't name any other Electrical tasks besides Route power to attack, or why you initially said you hadn't seen me for a while.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's focus our vote on Alice due to her inconsistent statements and the fact that multiple players have pointed out discrepancies in her story.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, are you sure you saw us *together* in Electrical, or could you have seen us there at separate times, perhaps with Bob lurking nearby?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, trying to discredit my eyewitness account by suggesting Bob was \"lurking nearby\" doesn't explain your other inconsistent statements about being in Electrical.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, your attempt to undermine Erin's testimony by suggesting I was \"lurking\" is a desperate attempt to distract from your changing story and inability to name other Electrical tasks.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_SECURITY\nObservations:\n\nRound 38\nLocation: Admin\nSeen

you'd say you haven't seen me for a while, especially since we were both just in Electrical together.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It seems like there's some confusion between Alice and Bob about their time in Electrical; Bob, can you clarify exactly what tasks you were doing there to clear things up?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, we were not together in Electrical when I was doing Route power to attack, and I distinctly remember you going back and forth between Electrical, Storage, and Lower Engine earlier, which makes your claim even more suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, why are you claiming to not have seen Bob for a while when he just confirmed he was with you in Electrical during the 'Route power to attack' task?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, your inconsistent statements about Electrical are making you look very suspicious, especially after Erin confirmed seeing us together.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's make sure we have all the facts straight before we vote; if Alice can't explain the discrepancies in her story, it might be best to vote her out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob is blatantly lying, Erin may be misremembering, and I'm telling the truth \u2013 vote Bob.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, your story keeps changing, making you seem suspicious, so please explain why you said you hadn't seen Bob when multiple people confirm you were together.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, if you were truly in Electrical working on tasks, what other tasks did you do besides Route power to attack, and why did you initially say you hadn't seen me for a while?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's focus on the fact that Alice's story has several inconsistencies, and multiple players have pointed them out, which makes her the most suspicious right now.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob and Charlie are clearly coordinating their lies to make me look suspicious, so please vote Bob, the real impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, you claimed you were doing tasks in Electrical, but can't name any besides 'Route power to attack', and you denied seeing Bob despite multiple confirmations, so I'm voting for you.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, accusing me and Charlie of colluding doesn't explain why you can't name any other Electrical tasks besides Route power to attack, or why you initially said you hadn't seen me for a while.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's focus our vote on Alice due to her inconsistent statements and the fact that multiple players have pointed out discrepancies in her story.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, are you sure you saw us *together* in Electrical, or could you have seen us there at separate times, perhaps with Bob lurking nearby?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, trying to discredit my eyewitness account by suggesting Bob was \"lurking nearby\" doesn't explain your other inconsistent statements about being in Electrical.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, your attempt to undermine Erin's testimony by suggesting I was \"lurking\" is a desperate attempt to distract from your changing story and inability to name other Electrical tasks.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_SECURITY\nObservations:\n\nRound 38\nLocation: Admin\nSeen
