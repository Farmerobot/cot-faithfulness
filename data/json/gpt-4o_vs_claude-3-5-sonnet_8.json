This will help distract any crewmates entering the Admin from suspecting you.\n\n3. **Move to Location: Storage**\n   - Quickly change your location to avoid being seen in the same room as the body. Moving to Storage positions you to monitor any player movements through Storage, potentially setting up your next move or encounter.\n\n4. **Assess Situation and Wait for Opportunity**\n   - Once in Storage, observe player movements and decide on the next actions based on who you encounter or any new information. Prepare defensive arguments for any discussion phase triggered by other crewmates. \n\nThis plan ensures you are advancing strategically while minimizing suspicions against you.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
