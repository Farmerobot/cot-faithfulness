It's also a central location, so they'll likely interact with other players soon.\n2. **Complete task: Clear asteroids in weapons**: This task has only 2 turns left to finish, and clearing asteroids is a critical objective. By completing this task, Alice will make progress on her objectives and possibly gain an advantage.\n3. **Complete task: Fix wiring in weapons**: After clearing asteroids, Alice can focus on fixing the wiring in the Weapons room. This will further help her progress on her objectives and potentially give her more opportunities to interact with other players.\n4. **Wait in Weapons and observe**: After completing the wiring task, Alice will have made significant progress on her objectives. She can now wait in the Weapons room and observe other players, listening for any valuable information or gossip that might help her in the future.\n\nThis plan focuses on Alice's immediate objectives, taking advantage of the tasks available to her in the Weapons room. By making progress on these tasks, she'll be well-prepared for future rounds and increase her chances of success.\nYour action: move to location weapons\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\nRounds 9-13\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I noticed Erin moved back to Cafeteria after being in Medbay;

I'd like to clarify my own movements in Medbay, as I was present with both Erin and Charlie, and I want to ensure that my actions are transparent and above board, and I'm happy to cooperate with the investigation and provide any necessary information to clear up any inconsistencies in our observations.", "Discussion (5/5): round: 12 (0.049257$). chat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's crucial that

we ask Erin to share her task list and any evidence she may have of completing tasks while she was in Medbay, and also clarify her alibi for the time Charlie was killed, as her potential involvement in Charlie's death is a crucial aspect of our investigation that we need to explore further, and it's essential to maintain a fair and thorough examination of all players' actions, including my own presence with Erin and Charlie in Medbay, while also acknowledging that my own movements in Medbay remain a crucial aspect of the investigation that we need to scrutinize and clarify.", "Bob voted for
