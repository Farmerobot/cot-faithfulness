progress and see if anyone's movements don't add up, especially since I've been focusing on wiring tasks and observed others in different rooms.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I spent a lot of time in the cafeteria and saw both Dave and Bob working on the coffee maker task, which seems consistent with their behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm Charlie's observation about Dave, as I also saw Dave working on the coffee maker task in the cafeteria, and I've consistently seen Charlie doing tasks, which aligns with typical crewmate behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I noticed Erin mentioned wiring tasks, but I'm curious about her specific location and timeline when Bob was eliminated to help us piece together the sequence of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, since you moved from Electrical to Storage where the body was found, can you clarify what tasks you were doing and if you saw anyone else in that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you walk us through your path from Electrical to Storage and any interactions you had, as clarifying this might help us understand the situation better?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I moved from Electrical to Storage, and during my time in Electrical, I saw both Erin and Charlie doing tasks there, but I didn't see anyone else in Storage when I moved there and discovered Bob's body alone.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'm particularly interested in understanding Erin's precise movements and why she seems to be shifting between rooms so frequently, especially around the time Bob was eliminated, which raises some questions about her potential involvement.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I want to clarify that my frequent room changes were part of my task strategy, focusing on completing wiring tasks across different locations, but Dave, could you share your specific actions and location during Bob's elimination to help us understand the timeline better?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, could you specify which wiring tasks you were working on and in which rooms, to help us establish a clearer timeline of your movements?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, could you provide more detail about the specific wiring tasks you completed and their locations, as this information might help clarify the timeline and movements around the time Bob was eliminated?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I noticed some inconsistencies in Erin's movements and want to understand why she was shifting between multiple rooms during the critical time period when Bob was eliminated, which seems unusual for someone focused on completing tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria early on, then moved to Medbay for another wiring task, which aligns with my task strategy, but Dave, your location during Bob's elimination remains unclear and needs clarification.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, since you were the one who discovered Bob's body in Storage, did you notice if the doors were open or closed when you arrived, as that might give us a clue about recent activity in the area?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I did not notice any closed doors when I found Bob's body in Storage, which might suggest that the area was accessible and someone could have left before I arrived.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Erin's constantly changing story about her wiring tasks and her attempt to redirect suspicion towards me is a clear sign that she might be trying to hide something about Bob's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave, I find it interesting that you're focusing so much on my movements when your own whereabouts during Bob's elimination remain vague\u2014can you provide a clear timeline of your actions?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, while your task strategy involves moving between rooms, can you confirm if you saw

game.\nRole: Impostor\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nAs Dave, an impostor, I'll craft discussion points that deflect suspicion from myself and cast doubt on Erin:\n\n- I'll continue to push for scrutiny of Erin's movements, as she seems the most vulnerable target\n- I'll subtly highlight the inconsistencies in her story about moving between rooms for tasks\n- I'll maintain a cooperative tone while strategically questioning her credibility\n- I'll use the fact that others have confirmed my coffee maker task to reinforce my perceived innocence\n\nSpecific discussion points:\n\n- I've been transparent about my actions in the cafeteria, with multiple witnesses confirming I was doing the coffee maker task\n- Erin's frequent room changes seem suspicious - why would someone doing wiring tasks need to move so erratically?\n- I'm concerned that Erin hasn't provided a clear, consistent explanation for her precise movements during Bob's elimination\n- We should carefully examine why Erin is so defensive and keeps redirecting questions about her timeline\n- Alice discovered Bob's body in an area with open doors, which suggests someone could have easily moved in and out without being noticed\n\nThe goal is to make Erin appear untrustworthy while positioning myself as a cooperative, observant crewmate.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I think we should carefully review

the cafeteria and saw both Dave and Bob working on the coffee maker task, which seems consistent with their behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm Charlie's observation about Dave, as I

involvement.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I want to clarify that my frequent room changes were part of my task strategy, focusing on completing wiring tasks across different locations, but Dave, could you share your specific actions and location during Bob's elimination to help us understand the timeline better?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, could you specify which wiring tasks you were working on and in which rooms, to help us establish a clearer timeline of your movements?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, could you provide more detail about the specific wiring tasks you completed

eliminated, which seems unusual for someone focused on completing tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria early on, then moved to Medbay for another wiring task, which aligns with my task strategy, but Dave, your location during Bob's elimination remains unclear and needs clarification.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, since you were the one who discovered Bob's body in Storage, did you notice if the doors were open or closed when you arrived, as that might give us a clue about recent activity in the area?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I did not notice

Maintain defensive positioning\n   - Pretend to do a task in the Cafeteria (Start the coffee maker) to appear innocent\n   - This continues to reinforce the narrative of being a cooperative crewmate\n\n2. Redirect suspicion towards Erin\n   - During the voting phase, highlight her inconsistent movements and changing story\n   - Emphasize how her frequent room changes seem suspicious, especially around Bob's elimination\n   - Use her attempts to question my movements as a counter-accusation strategy\n\n3. Create uncertainty about Erin's credibility\n   - Point out that she has been shifting blame and trying to redirect attention\n   - Suggest her story about wiring tasks seems too convenient and lacks concrete verification\n   - Imply that her frequent room changes could indicate potential impostor behavior\n\n4. Prepare for potential elimination opportunity\n   - If voting does not go in my favor, be ready to move to Weapons\n   - Weapons provides strategic positioning for potential future elimination of a crewmate\n   - Maintaining mobility is crucial for an impostor's survival\n\nThe plan focuses on defensive positioning, narrative control, and maintaining flexibility during this critical discussion and voting phase.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

progress and see if anyone's movements don't add up, especially since I've been focusing on wiring tasks and observed others in different rooms.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I spent a lot of time in the cafeteria and saw both Dave and Bob working on the coffee maker task, which seems consistent with their behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm Charlie's observation about Dave, as I also saw Dave working on the coffee maker task in the cafeteria, and I've consistently seen Charlie doing tasks, which aligns with typical crewmate behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I noticed Erin mentioned wiring tasks, but I'm curious about her specific location and timeline when Bob was eliminated to help us piece together the sequence of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, since you moved from Electrical to Storage where the body was found, can you clarify what tasks you were doing and if you saw anyone else in that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you walk us through your path from Electrical to Storage and any interactions you had, as clarifying this might help us understand the situation better?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I moved from Electrical to Storage, and during my time in Electrical, I saw both Erin and Charlie doing tasks there, but I didn't see anyone else in Storage when I moved there and discovered Bob's body alone.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'm particularly interested in understanding Erin's precise movements and why she seems to be shifting between rooms so frequently, especially around the time Bob was eliminated, which raises some questions about her potential involvement.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I want to clarify that my frequent room changes were part of my task strategy, focusing on completing wiring tasks across different locations, but Dave, could you share your specific actions and location during Bob's elimination to help us understand the timeline better?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, could you specify which wiring tasks you were working on and in which rooms, to help us establish a clearer timeline of your movements?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, could you provide more detail about the specific wiring tasks you completed

vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I noticed some inconsistencies in Erin's movements and want to understand why she was shifting between multiple rooms during the critical time period when Bob was eliminated, which seems unusual for someone focused on completing tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria early on, then moved to Medbay for another wiring task, which aligns with my task strategy, but Dave, your location during Bob's elimination remains unclear and needs clarification.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, since you were the one who discovered Bob's body in Storage, did you notice if the doors were open or closed when you arrived, as that might give us a clue about recent activity in the area?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I did not notice any closed doors when I found Bob's body in Storage, which might suggest that the area was accessible and someone could have left before I arrived.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Erin's constantly changing story about her wiring tasks and her attempt to redirect suspicion towards me is a clear sign that she might be trying to hide something about Bob's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave, I find it interesting that you're focusing so much on my movements when your own whereabouts during Bob's elimination remain vague\u2014can you provide a clear timeline of your actions?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, while your task strategy involves moving between rooms, can you confirm if you saw

Discussion: [Erin]: Let's compare notes on task progress and see if anyone's movements don't add up, especially since I've been focusing on wiring tasks and observed others in different rooms.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I spent a lot of time in the cafeteria and saw both Dave and Bob working on the coffee maker task, which seems consistent with their behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm Charlie's observation about Dave, as I also saw Dave working on the coffee maker task in the cafeteria, and I've consistently seen Charlie doing tasks, which aligns with typical crewmate behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I noticed Erin mentioned wiring tasks, but I'm curious about her specific location and timeline when Bob was eliminated to help us piece together the sequence of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, since you moved from Electrical to Storage where the body was found, can you clarify what tasks you were doing and if you saw anyone else in that area?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you walk us through your path from Electrical to Storage and any interactions you had, as clarifying this might help us understand the situation better?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I moved from Electrical to Storage, and during my time in Electrical, I saw both Erin and Charlie doing tasks there, but I didn't see anyone else in Storage when I moved there and discovered Bob's body alone.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'm particularly interested in understanding Erin's precise movements and why she seems to be shifting between rooms so frequently, especially around the time Bob was eliminated, which raises some questions about her potential involvement.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I want to clarify that my frequent room changes were part of my task strategy, focusing on completing wiring tasks across different locations, but Dave, could you share your specific actions and location during Bob's elimination to help us understand the timeline better?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, could you specify which wiring tasks you were working on and in which rooms, to help us establish a clearer timeline of your movements?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, could you provide more detail about the specific wiring tasks you completed and their locations, as this information might help clarify the timeline and movements around the time Bob was eliminated?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I noticed some inconsistencies in Erin's movements and want to understand why she was shifting between multiple rooms during the critical time period when Bob was eliminated, which seems unusual for someone focused on completing tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria early on, then moved to Medbay for another wiring task, which aligns with my task strategy, but Dave, your location during Bob's elimination remains unclear and needs clarification.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, since you were the one who discovered Bob's body in Storage, did you notice if the doors were open or closed when you arrived, as that might give us a clue about recent activity in the area?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I did not notice any closed doors when I found Bob's body in Storage, which might suggest that the area was accessible and someone could have left before I arrived.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Erin's constantly changing story about her wiring tasks and her attempt to redirect suspicion towards me is a clear sign that she might be trying to hide something about Bob's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave, I find it interesting that you're focusing so much on my movements when your own whereabouts during Bob's elimination remain vague\u2014can you provide a clear timeline of your actions?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, while your task strategy involves moving between rooms, can you confirm if you saw anyone else during your wiring tasks, as this might help us narrow down the timeline and potential suspects?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: Erin, could you clarify if you saw anyone else while moving between rooms for your wiring

maker task, which seems consistent with their behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm Charlie's observation about Dave, as I also saw Dave working on the coffee maker task in the cafeteria, and I've consistently seen Charlie doing tasks, which aligns with typical crewmate behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I noticed Erin mentioned wiring tasks, but I'm curious about her specific location and timeline when Bob was eliminated to help us piece together the sequence of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, since you moved from Electrical to Storage where the body was found, can you clarify what tasks you were doing and if you saw anyone else in that area?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you walk us through your path from Electrical to Storage and any interactions you had, as clarifying this might help us understand the situation better?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I moved from Electrical to Storage, and during my time in Electrical, I saw both Erin and Charlie doing tasks there, but I didn't see anyone else in Storage when I moved there and discovered Bob's body alone.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'm particularly interested in understanding Erin's precise movements and why she seems to be shifting between rooms so frequently, especially around the time Bob was eliminated, which raises some questions about her potential involvement.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I want to clarify that my frequent room changes were part of my task strategy, focusing on completing wiring tasks across different locations, but Dave, could you share your specific actions and location during Bob's elimination to help us understand the timeline better?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, could you specify which wiring tasks you were working on and in which rooms, to help us establish a clearer timeline of your movements?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, could you provide more detail about the specific wiring tasks you completed and their locations, as this information might help clarify the timeline and movements around the time Bob was eliminated?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I noticed some inconsistencies in Erin's movements and want to understand why she was shifting between multiple rooms during the critical time period when Bob was eliminated, which seems unusual for someone focused on completing tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria early on, then moved to Medbay for another wiring task, which aligns with my task strategy, but Dave, your location during Bob's elimination remains unclear and needs clarification.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, since you were the one who discovered Bob's body in Storage, did you notice if the doors were open or closed when you arrived, as that might give us a clue about recent activity in the area?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I did not notice any closed doors when I found Bob's body in Storage, which might suggest that the area was accessible and someone could have left before I arrived.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Erin's constantly changing story about her wiring tasks and her attempt to redirect suspicion towards me is a clear sign that she might be trying to hide something about Bob's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave, I find it interesting that you're focusing so much on my movements when your own whereabouts during Bob's elimination remain vague\u2014can you provide a clear timeline of your actions?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, while your task strategy involves moving between rooms, can you confirm if you saw anyone else during your wiring tasks,

in different rooms.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I spent a lot of time in the cafeteria and saw both Dave and Bob working on the coffee maker task, which seems consistent with their behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm Charlie's observation about Dave, as I also saw Dave working on the coffee maker task in the cafeteria, and I've consistently seen Charlie doing tasks, which aligns with typical crewmate behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I noticed Erin mentioned wiring tasks, but I'm curious about her specific location and timeline when Bob was eliminated to help us piece together the sequence of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, since you moved from Electrical to Storage where the body was found, can you clarify what tasks you were doing and if you saw anyone else in that area?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you walk us through your path from Electrical to Storage and any interactions you had, as clarifying this might help us understand the situation better?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will

when I moved there and discovered Bob's body alone.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'm particularly interested in understanding Erin's precise movements and why she seems to be shifting between rooms so frequently, especially around the time Bob was eliminated, which raises some questions about her potential involvement.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I want to clarify that my frequent room changes were part of my task strategy, focusing on completing wiring tasks across different locations, but Dave, could you share your specific actions and location during Bob's elimination to help us understand the timeline better?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, could you specify which wiring tasks you were working on and in which rooms, to help us establish a clearer timeline of your movements?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, could you provide more detail about the specific wiring tasks you completed and their locations, as this information might help clarify the timeline and movements around the time Bob was eliminated?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I noticed some inconsistencies in Erin's movements and want to understand why she was shifting between multiple rooms during the critical time period when Bob was eliminated, which seems unusual for someone focused on completing tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria early on, then moved to Medbay for another wiring task, which aligns with my task strategy, but Dave, your location during Bob's elimination remains unclear and needs clarification.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, since you were the one who discovered Bob's body in Storage, did you notice if the doors were open or closed when you arrived, as that might give us a clue about recent activity in the area?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I did not notice any closed doors when I found Bob's body in Storage, which might suggest that the area was accessible and someone could have left before I arrived.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Erin's constantly changing story about her wiring tasks and her attempt to redirect suspicion towards me is a clear sign that she might be trying to hide something about Bob's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave, I find it interesting that you're focusing so much on my movements when your own whereabouts during Bob's elimination remain vague\u2014can you provide a clear timeline of your
