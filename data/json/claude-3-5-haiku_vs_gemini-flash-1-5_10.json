Dave corroborated my account of seeing Charlie eliminate Erin, and his continued denials and attempts to shift blame are highly suspicious.  Delaying the vote risks another crewmate being killed.\n\n- Charlie's insistence on reviewing security footage feels like a stalling tactic. While footage would be helpful, we have eyewitness testimony from both myself and Dave.  Acting decisively is crucial to prevent further losses.\n\n-  Let's not get bogged down in analyzing the timing of our reports.  The fact remains: Erin is dead, I witnessed Charlie doing it, and Dave confirms it.  This is more important than questioning our coordination.\n\n-  Bob, I understand your concern about fairness, but we're running out of time.  We can review the footage *after* we eliminate the immediate threat.  Waiting could be fatal.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I think we should focus on completing our tasks and tracking our overall progress, as that's the most important thing right now.\n[Alice]: I saw Charlie eliminate Erin in Medbay;
