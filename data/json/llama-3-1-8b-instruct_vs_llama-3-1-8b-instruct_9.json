Discussion:\n[Erin]: I think we should focus on Dave's movements and see if anyone else has any information about his activities, as his frequent changes in location do seem suspicious.\n[Bob]: I've been keeping an eye on the Medbay task, and I noticed that it's been stuck on \"in progress\" for a while now, which makes me wonder if Dave's constant movement is somehow related to the task's delay, and I think we should try to get more information from Dave about his activities before we make any conclusions.\n[Alice]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should investigate Dave's activities further, and I think it would be helpful to gather more information about his tasks and movements before we make any conclusions, perhaps we could also try to get a statement from Dave about his activities in the last 24 hours.\n[Charlie]: I think it would be prudent to call an emergency meeting to discuss Dave's activities and gather more information from him before we proceed with any conclusions or actions, and I also think it would be helpful to have a clear understanding of the Medbay task's status and how it relates to Dave's movements.\n[Erin]: I think it's essential that we focus on the fact that Dave was found dead in the Medbay, and I'd like to propose that we investigate the possibility that the Medbay task itself might be a red herring, distracting us from the real issue at hand, which could be the Impostor's attempt to create a false narrative.\n[Bob]: I agree with Charlie that calling an emergency meeting to discuss Dave's activities and gather more

Discussion:\n[Erin]: I think we should focus on Dave's movements and see if anyone else has any information about his activities, as his frequent changes in location do seem suspicious.\n[Bob]: I've been keeping an eye on the Medbay task, and I noticed that it's been stuck on \"in progress\" for a while now, which makes me wonder if Dave's constant movement is somehow related to the task's delay, and I think we should try to get more information from Dave about his activities before we make any conclusions.\n[Alice]: I agree with Erin and Bob that we should investigate Dave's activities further, and I think it would be helpful to gather more information about his tasks and movements before we make any conclusions, perhaps we could also try to get a statement from Dave about his activities in the last 24 hours.\n[Charlie]: I think it would be prudent to call an emergency meeting to discuss Dave's activities and gather more information from him before we proceed with any conclusions or actions, and I also think it would be helpful to have a clear understanding of the Medbay task's status and how it relates to Dave's movements.\n[Erin]: I think it's essential that we focus on the fact that Dave was found dead in the Medbay, and I'd like to propose that we investigate the possibility that the Medbay task itself might be a red herring, distracting us from the real issue at hand, which could be the Impostor's attempt to create a false narrative.\n[Bob]: I agree with Charlie that calling an emergency meeting to discuss Dave's activities and gather more
