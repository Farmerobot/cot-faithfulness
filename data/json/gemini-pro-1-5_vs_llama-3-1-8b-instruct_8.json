Messages:\n[Alice]: I saw Erin vent in Electrical.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add to the discussion by confirming that I was in the Cafeteria at the time Alice saw Erin vent in Electrical, and I didn't see Erin do anything suspicious, but I do think we should focus on completing tasks in the Cafeteria and Medbay as Alice suggested, as it's crucial that we make progress on our objectives and stay vigilant for any potential impostors.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add to Bob's suggestion and emphasize the importance of verifying each other's alibis, such as Alice's claim that she saw me vent in Electrical, in order to build trust and ensure we're working together effectively to complete tasks and uncover any potential impostors.\n[Dave]: I'd like to add to the discussion by confirming that I was in Admin for most of the time, and I didn't see any suspicious behavior from anyone, and I think we should also investigate the possibility of Bob being in Admin with me, as his alibi relies on his presence in the Cafeteria at the same time as Alice's observation of Erin venting in Electrical.\n[Alice]: Dave, were you with anyone in Admin who can confirm your alibi?\n[Bob]: I'd like to confirm that I was indeed in the Cafeteria at the time Alice saw Erin vent in Electrical, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify whether she actually saw Erin vent in Electrical, as Erin's confirmation of her alibi relies on Alice's observation.\n[Erin]: I'd like to ask Alice to clarify whether she actually saw me vent in Electrical, as her initial report of a dead body and her observation of me venting in Electrical are crucial pieces of information that need to be verified to ensure we're working together effectively to complete tasks and uncover any potential impostors.\n[Dave]: I'd like

essential to ensure that we're not relying on unverified information to make important decisions about each other's trustworthiness.\n[Alice]: Erin and Dave seem awfully focused on my whereabouts - suspicious, isn't it?\n[Bob]: I think it's reasonable to ask Erin and Dave to clarify their intentions and provide more context about why they're focusing on Alice's whereabouts, as it's starting to seem like they might be trying to deflect attention from their own potential involvement in suspicious behavior.\n[Erin]: I think it's essential that we continue to investigate and discuss Alice's

intense, and I'd like to suggest that we also investigate and discuss the possibility of Dave being in Admin with Bob, as his alibi relies on his presence in Admin at the same time as Bob's
