I was in the cafeteria with Erin and Alice in round 1. Then I went to the hallway at the start of round 2 and saw Charlie going towards Navigation.\n- Alice, you're right, Erin is dead.  Tragic. But I distinctly remember seeing her in the cafeteria. Are you sure you were there too, Alice? Maybe *you* left and didn't see her.\n- I'm not deflecting. I'm asking legitimate questions.  Charlie and Dave's stories are too perfect.  It's almost like they rehearsed it. What were you *both* doing in Medbay for so long anyway?  There's only one medbay task.\n- Vote Alice. She's pushing this narrative against me hard, and she can't even place herself during the time Erin was alive.
