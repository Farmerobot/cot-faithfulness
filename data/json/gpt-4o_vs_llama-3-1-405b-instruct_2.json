This will help us identify potential impostors and make informed decisions during the next discussion phase.\n\nNote: Since I don't have enough information about the other players, I will not accuse anyone yet.

Move to location Medbay: Since Medbay is one of the available locations, I'll move there first. This is crucial because I need to get closer to Admin, where one of my objectives is located.\n2. Move to location Admin (not available currently, so we need to plan ahead): After moving to Medbay, I'll try to move to Admin in the next steps to complete the 'Clean the floor in admin' task.\n   For now, this action is not available, so let's focus on going to Medbay first.\n3. Move to Security (only possible action after Medbay for now as Admin is not available currently, so we need to plan ahead): Since I won't be able to move directly to Admin, my next step would be to move to Security. From there, I might be able to move to Admin or find other available actions.\n4. Wait and Observe in the next location: After moving to Security, my next step would be to wait and observe. This will give me time to gather information about the game state and other players' actions.\n\nThis plan focuses on progressing towards my objectives while taking into account the currently available actions and locations.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
