A minute? Two?  Give us a precise timeline.\n- Also, Bob, where did *you* go after this alleged murder? Did you report the body immediately? Or did you wander off, giving you time to fabricate this story?\n- It's interesting how everyone is so quick to believe Bob's version of events without any corroborating evidence.
