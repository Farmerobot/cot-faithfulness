Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Weapons the entire time working on the asteroid clearing task, a multi-stage process, and saw no one else;  I also saw Erin in the Cafeteria starting the coffee maker, which might be a task, and I'd appreciate Alice clarifying her movements between the Cafeteria and Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can corroborate both Erin and Bob's accounts; I saw Erin starting the coffee machine in the cafeteria while I was working on wiring, and I agree that Alice's movements need further clarification.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the new information about Alice's tragic fate in Medbay, I think it's crucial that we focus on identifying who could have been in Medbay around the time of her death, and I'd especially like to hear from Charlie if he noticed anyone entering or leaving Medbay while he was working in the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Alice's death and the corroborating accounts of Erin and Charlie, I propose we meticulously examine everyone's reported movements around Medbay to identify any inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Bob's proposed step-by-step examination of everyone's Medbay alibi, and I can confirm that while in the Cafeteria, I didn't see anyone enter or leave Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we're getting a bit too focused on Medbay and individual alibis, shouldn't we also consider the possibility that someone might have used a vent to move around undetected, and maybe we should investigate those areas as well?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: To further refine our investigation, let's combine the timeline of events with an examination of vent access points near Medbay and Weapons, focusing on who had the opportunity to use them around the time of Alice's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Bob's suggestion to cross-reference everyone's alibis with known vent locations near Medbay and Weapons to identify any potential inconsistencies.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to add that while we're investigating the vents and alibis, we should also consider the potential motives behind Alice's murder, as understanding the killer's reasoning could help us uncover their identity.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's prioritize confirming the whereabouts of everyone near Medbay, then cross-reference that information with vent locations to identify any discrepancies in their accounts.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Bob's suggestion to cross-reference everyone's alibis with vent locations,

[Erin]: I think it's interesting that Bob and Charlie are so focused on cross-referencing alibis and vent locations, but neither of them has provided a clear account of their own movements around the

alibis and vent locations, but neither of them has provided a clear account of their own movements around the time of Alice's death.\n- As we're running out of time, I propose we take a closer look at the inconsistencies in Bob's story - he claimed to be in Weapons the entire time, but also mentioned seeing me in the Cafeteria, which raises questions about his actual whereabouts.\n- Charlie's corroborating account of my coffee maker task seems suspiciously convenient, especially since he's been agreeing with Bob's suggestions without providing much new information - could they be working together to distract us from their own activities?\n- I think it's crucial that we don't overlook the potential motives behind Alice's murder - was she getting close to discovering something, or was she a threat to someone's plans? Understanding the killer's reasoning could help us uncover their identity.\n- Given the lack of clear evidence and the inconsistencies in everyone's stories, I think it's premature to start accusing individuals without more concrete proof - we should focus on gathering more information and exploring all possible explanations before making any decisions.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I'd like to hear from Bob about his visit to Weapons, and also from Alice about her task-hopping between Cafeteria and Medbay, can you both please clarify what you were doing?\n[Bob]: I was in Weapons the entire time working on the asteroid clearing task, a multi-stage process, and saw no one else;
