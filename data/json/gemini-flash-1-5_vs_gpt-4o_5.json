She claims to have been in Medbay the entire time, yet Bob's body was found in the cafeteria.  This seems like a significant inconsistency.\n\n-  I'm still unconvinced by Erin's explanation.  It's crucial to understand the timeline of events.  Can anyone else corroborate her movements?\n\n-  It's interesting that Alice didn't see anything suspicious while I was \"emptying the trash.\"  This further strengthens my alibi, doesn't it?  Perhaps we should focus on other suspects.\n\n-  Dave's account of being alone in Admin is also noteworthy.  It seems like the focus should be on who had the opportunity to eliminate Bob.\n\n-  Let's vote for Erin.

While it's important to clarify inconsistencies, we should also consider other possibilities. Could it be that someone else moved between rooms quickly after I left the cafeteria?\n- I was alone in Admin and didn't hear or see anything unusual. This makes it difficult to account for any quick movements between rooms, but it's still worth considering if someone could have slipped by.\n- Alice, since you confirmed seeing Charlie and Bob in the cafeteria and reported the body, did you notice anyone else leaving the cafeteria after Bob's task was completed?\n- Erin, if you didn't see anyone in Medbay, could someone have used the opportunity to move elsewhere unnoticed? This might explain the lack of witnesses in both Medbay and Admin.\n- We should also consider the possibility of a self-report or a quick elimination.
