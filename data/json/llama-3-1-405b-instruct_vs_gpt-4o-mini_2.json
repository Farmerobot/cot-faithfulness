any tasks there; can either of you explain what you were doing?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can confirm that I saw both Alice and Charlie in the Cafeteria earlier, but Erin's observation about them not completing tasks in Medbay is concerning, and we need to clarify their actions there to ensure they're not faking tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think Erin's message is an attempt to deflect attention from herself, as she was also in Medbay and didn't complete any tasks that I saw.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your attempt to shift blame onto me is transparent; I was actively completing tasks and then moved to Medbay to submit my scan, while you were just waiting around without any clear task completion to show for it.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: We need to focus on the timeline of events in Medbay; if Charlie was there with both Alice and Erin, we should ask him why he didn't complete any tasks and clarify what he was doing instead.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that I was indeed working on a task in Medbay, specifically ensuring the medical equipment was functioning properly, and I'd appreciate it if Erin could provide more details about the tasks she claims to have completed in Medbay, as I didn't witness her working on anything specific during my

properly\" lacks the specifics needed to verify your actions, and I urge Alice to share what she observed during that time to help clarify the situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: We need to hear from Alice to clarify what she witnessed in Medbay, as her perspective could help us determine if either Charlie or Erin is trying to deflect blame with their vague explanations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's telling that Erin is still avoiding providing concrete details about her task completion in Medbay, and instead continues to try to shift the focus onto me and Alice, which only adds to my suspicion that she might be hiding something.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, your repeated attempts to cast doubt on my actions while failing to provide solid evidence of your own task completion in Medbay only heighten my suspicion, and I still urge Alice to share her observations to help us get to the truth.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I agree with Erin that Charlie's vague claims about his actions in Medbay are suspicious, and it\u2019s crucial for Alice to speak up to clarify what she observed, as her account could be pivotal in determining who is being dishonest here.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to ask Bob why he thinks my claims about working on a task in Medbay are suspicious,
