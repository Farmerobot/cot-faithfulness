she killed Dave right after his medscan cleared him, and her constant deflection about investigating other areas is clearly a desperate attempt to avoid scrutiny of her actions in Medbay\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I think it's a great idea to investigate other areas of the ship, and I'd love to join a team to check out the Engine Room, I've heard some rumors about a possible issue with the oxygen generator.\n[Bob]: Since we're discussing locations, I can confirm Dave is clear - I saw him doing the medical scan in Medbay, which is a visual task that can't be faked.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Bob about Dave being cleared, but I can also vouch for Bob since I saw him doing wiring tasks in Cafeteria earlier, so that's two people we can trust.\n[Alice]: While I can confirm Bob's story about the wiring tasks since I saw him in Cafeteria, I think we should split up from Medbay to cover more ground and complete our remaining tasks efficiently.\n[Erin]: I think we should focus on verifying the alibis of Bob and Charlie, as they're the ones who claim to have seen each other in Cafeteria, and it would be great to get a clearer picture of what really happened in Medbay.\n[Bob]: Given Dave's death right after I confirmed his medscan, we need to focus on who was in and around Medbay - I was there with Alice and Erin when this happened, but I was occupied with the diagnostic task.\n[Charlie]: Given that Dave was killed right after being cleared by medscan, and Bob, Alice, and Erin were all in Medbay at the time, we need to carefully examine what each of them was doing during those crucial moments.\n[Alice]: I need to report that I discovered Dave's body in Medbay just moments after arriving from Cafeteria, and while Bob and Erin were both present, I'm particularly concerned about how Dave was killed right after being cleared by medscan.\n[Erin]: I think we should focus on verifying the alibis of Bob and Charlie, as they're the ones who claim to have seen each other in Cafeteria, and it would be great to get a clearer picture of what really happened in Medbay, but I'm also curious about Erin's sudden interest in investigating the Engine Room, and I think we should keep a close eye on her as well.\n[Bob]: Given that Alice discovered Dave's body in Medbay while both Erin and I were present, I find it highly suspicious that Erin keeps trying to redirect our attention to the Engine Room and question my verified alibi in Cafeteria instead of explaining her own actions in Medbay during the murder.\n[Charlie]: Based on all the evidence we've gathered, I'm now completely convinced Erin is the impostor - they were in Medbay when Dave was killed, keep trying to deflect attention to the Engine Room, and suspiciously question verified alibis instead of explaining their own actions.\n[Alice]: I think we need to focus on the fact that Erin was one of the first to leave Cafeteria for Medbay in Round 1, and now she's desperately trying to shift attention away from Medbay where Dave was killed right after his medscan cleared him.\n[Erin]: I think we're getting a bit too caught up in speculation and accusations, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and re-examine the timeline of events, including my own actions, to ensure we're not jumping to conclusions or unfairly targeting any one person, especially considering I was the one who initially suggested investigating other areas of the ship, including the Engine Room, which might hold valuable information to help us uncover the truth about Dave's death.\n[Bob]: Given that multiple players have verified my activities in Cafeteria and Medbay, while Erin continues to deflect and refuses to explain her actions during Dave's murder, I believe we have enough evidence to make our decision about who the impostor is.\n[Charlie]: The evidence against Erin is overwhelming - she moved from Cafeteria to Medbay in Round 1, was present during Dave's murder right after his medscan cleared him, and keeps trying to deflect attention away from her suspicious behavior by questioning verified alibis and suggesting we investigate the Engine Room.\n[Alice]: The fact that Erin keeps trying to redirect our attention to the Engine Room while refusing to explain what she was doing in Medbay during Dave's murder, combined with her being one of the first to leave Cafeteria and her presence at the crime scene, makes her behavior extremely suspicious and worthy of our vote.\n[Erin]: I think we're getting too caught up in speculation and accusations, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and re-examine the timeline of events, including my own actions, to ensure we're not jumping to conclusions or unfairly targeting any one person, especially considering I was the one who initially suggested investigating other areas of the ship, including the Engine Room, which might hold valuable information to help us uncover the truth about Dave's death.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "Given that we have multiple witnesses confirming my activities in both Cafeteria and Medbay, while Erin still hasn't explained her actions during Dave's murder and keeps trying to divert attention elsewhere, I think it's clear we need to vote for Erin.", "action_result": "", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "", "observations": [], "chat_messages": ["chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's a great idea to investigate other areas of the ship, and I'd love to join a team to check out the Engine Room, I've heard some rumors about a possible issue with the oxygen generator.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since we're discussing locations, I can confirm Dave is clear -
