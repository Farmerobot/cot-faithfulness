This will provide objective evidence to corroborate or contradict everyone's statements.  We need concrete data, not just recollections.\n\n- I agree with the suggestion to focus on Dave and Erin.  Their eagerness to verify timelines, coupled with Dave's alibi for both himself and Erin, is suspicious.  Let's scrutinize their accounts rigorously.\n\n- While I appreciate Bob's vigilance, let's avoid making accusations without concrete evidence.  The task logs will help us determine if anyone's account is inconsistent with the objective record.\n\n-  If we find discrepancies between reported locations/task completion times and the task logs, we should focus our attention on those individuals.

Let's focus on the round before Alice's death to ensure accuracy.  This will help eliminate any doubt about our whereabouts.\n\n-  While I appreciate Dave's vouching, Bob's concerns about potential collusion between Dave and me are valid.  We need to be transparent and provide concrete evidence to support our claims.  Let's all provide specific task completion times and locations from the relevant round.\n\n-  I was in Medbay with Dave in the round before Alice's death, completing the scan.  I can confirm this with the task log.  Let's see if everyone else's accounts align with the official record.  Discrepancies need to be addressed.\n\n-  It's important to remember that even if our accounts align, it doesn't definitively prove our innocence.  The impostor could be manipulating information or planting false evidence. We need to consider all possibilities.\n\n- Let's not jump to conclusions based on speculation.  Let's stick to the facts and the task logs to make an informed decision.  Focusing on verifiable evidence will help us identify the impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I was just finishing up a task at the coffee maker in the Cafeteria and didn\u2019t see anyone enter or leave, but I did notice Charlie heading towards Weapons and Erin going to Medbay, which could leave them isolated.\n[Charlie]: I can confirm Bob's statement about seeing me in Weapons completing the asteroid task, and I'm now heading to Medbay to assist Erin;
