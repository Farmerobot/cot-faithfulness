This is a fact, not a coordinated story.\n\n- Dave's behavior is highly suspicious for three reasons: 1) He questioned Alice's silence before we knew she was dead 2) He claims he was in Weapons when we all saw him leave Cafeteria just before the murder 3) He keeps changing his story about Alice's location\n\n- The timeline is crucial here - Dave left the Cafeteria right after Alice moved from wiring to trash, making him the last person near her before her death. His attempt to claim he was already in Weapons doesn't match what we all witnessed.\n\n- I'm willing to stake my credibility as a crewmate on this - I was doing the coffee maker task and had a clear view of everything that happened in the Cafeteria during this time period.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I'll help you play as Erin, an impostor trying to blend in and avoid detection.

It's efficient because it maximizes your current position before moving, and sets you up to handle the time-limited task next.\nYour action: complete task: start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Erin, Alice]\nRounds 3-7\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'll help you play as Erin, an impostor trying to blend in and avoid detection. Based on the discussion points and the goal of maintaining a convincing crewmate persona, here's a strategic response:\n\nI was definitely working on the wiring task in the Cafeteria, and I'm curious what everyone else was doing during that time.\n\nThis response accomplishes several key objectives:\n- Reinforces the alibi of working on a task\n- Appears cooperative by showing interest in others' locations\n- Shifts focus to other players, potentially drawing suspicion away from herself\n- Sounds natural and not overly defensive\n- Encourages others to share their own movements, which can help her gather information\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can confirm I saw Erin working on wiring in the cafeteria, and I was right there starting the coffee maker task.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can back up what Charlie and Erin are saying - I saw them both in the cafeteria while I was emptying the trash, and I noticed Alice and Dave there too doing tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I noticed something odd - while we're all confirming our presence in the cafeteria, Alice hasn't spoken up yet to verify what she was doing with the wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'll help investigate Alice's absence from the discussion, but Dave, you seem overly eager to cast suspicion on her when multiple people, including Bob and Charlie, can confirm she was doing the trash task in the cafeteria just before her death.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I need to report that I just found Alice's body by the trash in the cafeteria, and it's concerning that Dave was so quick to point out her silence when she was already dead.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave's behavior is extremely suspicious - he tried to cast doubt on Alice's silence right before her body was found, and he was one of the last people near her in the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I specifically remember seeing Alice at the wiring panel, not the trash - Erin's getting that detail wrong, and I left for Weapons well before the murder must have happened.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I saw Dave near Alice just before her body was discovered, and his changing story about her location makes me think he's trying to hide something.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's story about Alice being at wiring completely contradicts what I saw with my own eyes - she moved from wiring to the trash task where we found her body, and he was one of the last people near her.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that Dave's accusation about Alice's silence when she was already dead, combined with his inconsistent story about her location, makes him our prime suspect.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Charlie, Bob, and Erin keep changing their story about Alice's location between trash and wiring is highly suspicious, and they seem to be working together to frame me when I was already in Weapons.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave's inconsistent statements about Alice's location and his attempt to cast suspicion on her before her body was found make him the most likely suspect in her murder.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: We're not changing our stories at all - Alice moved from wiring to trash during that time period, which Dave would have seen if he was really in the cafeteria like he claims.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave's defensive behavior and attempt to claim he was in Weapons directly contradicts what I saw - he was definitely still in the cafeteria when Alice moved from wiring to the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The three of you keep coordinating your stories about Alice moving between tasks, but I was genuinely in Weapons when this happened, and your synchronized accusations against me seem very orchestrated.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I saw Dave's behavior as increasingly suspicious, especially how he's trying to cast doubt on our consistent testimony about Alice's movements before her death.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's claim about being in Weapons is impossible since I watched him leave the Cafeteria right after Alice moved to the trash area where her body was found.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave's attempt to discredit our consistent accounts by calling them \"coordinated\" is absurd - we're simply telling the truth about what we all witnessed in the cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that all three of you claim to have witnessed Alice move from wiring to trash, yet none of you reported her body immediately, makes your coordinated story highly suspicious.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 8\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Erin moved to Weapons from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location in the Cafeteria and available actions, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

Has anyone else been to Weapons recently?\n\n- The fact that we can all verify each other's locations and tasks in the cafeteria during round 1 is good, but we should stay alert about round 2 movements.\n\n- I'm a bit concerned that Bob moved to Admin alone - maybe we should try to stay in pairs for safety?", "I noticed something odd - while we're all confirming our presence in the cafeteria, Alice hasn't spoken up yet to verify what she was doing with the wiring task.", "Based on the discussion and my role as a crewmate, here are my discussion points:\n\n- I was in the cafeteria doing the coffee maker task, which Charlie and Bob can confirm, before moving to Weapons\n- I pointed out Alice's silence because it seemed unusual at the time - I had no way of knowing she was dead\n- I actually saw Alice doing wiring in cafeteria, not trash as Erin incorrectly stated, which makes me question Erin's reliability\n- I moved to Weapons alone and was there when the body was reported - I wasn't anywhere near the cafeteria when Alice must have been killed\n- It's concerning that Erin is trying to twist my legitimate question about Alice's silence into something suspicious, while also getting Alice's task wrong\n- We should focus on who stayed behind in the cafeteria after I left - that's more likely to reveal the killer", "I specifically remember seeing Alice at the wiring panel, not the trash - Erin's getting that detail wrong, and I left for Weapons well before the murder must have happened.", "- I need to defend myself clearly - I saw Alice at the wiring panel with my own eyes, and I completed my coffee maker task before moving to Weapons\n- It's suspicious that Erin first claimed Alice was at trash, then changed her story when I pointed out she was at wiring - seems like Erin is making up details\n- Charlie and Bob are both backing Erin's changing story, which makes me wonder if one of them is working with her\n- I was one of the first to leave the cafeteria for Weapons, so I couldn't have been \"one of the last people near her\"\n- I think Erin is trying to frame me because I noticed inconsistencies in her story - she's the one who seems to be lying about Alice's location", "The fact that Charlie, Bob, and Erin keep changing their story about Alice's location between trash and wiring is highly suspicious, and they seem to be working together to frame me when I was already in Weapons.", "Based on my role as a crewmate and the current discussion, here are my key points:\n\n- I need to firmly state that my observations are true - I saw Alice at the wiring panel in cafeteria with my own eyes, and I have no reason to lie about this\n- I can provide a clear timeline: I completed my coffee maker task and left for Weapons while Alice was still at wiring. I was nowhere near the trash area\n- It's suspicious that Erin, Charlie, and Bob are coordinating their stories and changing details about Alice's location between wiring and trash\n- The fact that they're all backing each other up while trying to frame me suggests they might be working together as impostors\n- I challenge anyone to explain why I would point out Alice's silence if I had just killed her - that makes no logical sense and shows I was genuinely unaware of her death", "The three of you keep coordinating your stories about Alice moving between tasks, but I was genuinely in Weapons when this happened, and your synchronized accusations against me seem very orchestrated.", "Based on my role as a crewmate and the current discussion, here are my key points:\n\n- My observations from Round 1 clearly show that Alice was at the wiring task, which I can state with absolute certainty.
