Wait for an opportunity to catch isolated crewmates (Storage is a high-traffic area where you might find solo targets)\n\nReasoning: This plan continues your strategy of blending in while positioning yourself for potential eliminations.

Pretend doing a task in Storage when you get there (This will help establish an alibi for when the body is found)\n\nReasoning: This is an ideal situation for an impostor - you're alone with a crewmate in Admin, which isn't a highly trafficked area.

Move to Storage after discussion (This provides a good position for future opportunities with multiple escape routes)\n\nReasoning: Since Charlie's body is in Admin with you, reporting it now is the best move. This makes you appear as a responsible crewmate and gives you control of the narrative during the discussion phase. Mentioning your earlier observation of Charlie helps establish your credibility.

By moving to Medbay, you can verify their claims while potentially finding an isolated target. Maintaining your cover with visible tasks remains important, but eliminating Erin would be strategic as they've been actively participating in discussions and providing alibis for others.
