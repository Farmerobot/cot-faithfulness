provide a clear explanation of their actions after completing their tasks in the cafeteria, as this could help us identify any potential impostors who might be trying to deflect attention from themselves.\n- I'd also like to ask Dave why he was \"pretending\" to empty the trash, as this behavior seems suspicious and could indicate that he's trying to hide something.\n- I think we should focus on verifying everyone's task progress and movements rather than jumping to conclusions based on incomplete information, and I propose that we ask each player to provide a detailed account of
