GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I was in the cafeteria earlier doing tasks, and I can confirm I saw Dave and Charlie there as well.\n[Charlie]: I was in the cafeteria with Erin and can confirm she was starting the coffee maker task, and I saw Bob and Alice working on their tasks during that time.\n[Bob]: I can confirm Charlie and Erin's statements about the cafeteria, and I'm currently in Medbay with Alice completing my scan task, which should help validate my movements and intentions.\n[Alice]: I agree with Bob that our Medbay scan task provides clear evidence of our whereabouts, and I support continuing to track everyone's movements systematically to identify any potential inconsistencies.\n[Erin]: I just discovered Dave's body in Admin while going to check on the wiring task - I had to report it immediately, but we should discuss who had access to that area recently.\n[Charlie]: I think we need to carefully investigate who was near Admin before Dave's body was discovered, and I'm willing to share my own movements to help us piece together what might have happened.\n[Bob]: I suggest we carefully examine Erin's timeline and ask her to provide more specific details about when she discovered Dave's body and what she observed in Admin before and after finding him.\n[Alice]: I think we should carefully review Erin's exact path through Admin when she discovered Dave's body, and ask her to specify precisely what she saw and who might have been near the area just before her discovery.\n[Erin]: Since everyone seems focused on my movements, I want to point out that Charlie hasn't explained where they went after leaving the cafeteria, which seems more suspicious than my clear path from cafeteria to Admin.\n[Charlie]: I was in Weapons working on my wiring task after leaving the cafeteria, and I'm completely transparent about my movements, which can be easily verified by other players who saw me there.\n[Bob]: I suggest we carefully examine Erin's sudden shift of suspicion towards Charlie and ask her to provide a detailed, moment-by-moment account of her exact path through Admin and the circumstances of finding Dave's body, as her redirection of blame seems potentially suspicious.\n[Alice]: I noticed Erin is attempting to deflect suspicion by pointing fingers at Charlie, but her own movements between the cafeteria and Admin seem highly irregular and require a thorough explanation of her exact route and purpose for moving between those locations.\n[Erin]: I find it suspicious that Bob and Alice are so quick to coordinate their accusations against me when they've been together in Medbay this whole time - perhaps they're working together as the real impostors?\n[Charlie]: I believe we need to maintain a calm and systematic approach to investigating Dave's death, and I'm confident that by carefully tracking everyone's movements and asking precise questions, we can uncover the truth without allowing Erin's attempts to create confusion to derail our investigation.\n[Bob]: I want to directly challenge Erin's latest accusation by emphasizing that my Medbay scan task provides a verifiable alibi, and her attempt to redirect suspicion towards Alice and me appears to be a desperate tactic to avoid scrutiny of her own inconsistent and suspicious movements around Dave's body in Admin.\n[Alice]: I propose we focus on Erin's inconsistent narrative about discovering Dave's body in Admin, as her shifting explanations and attempts to deflect suspicion make her the most suspicious player at this moment.\n[Erin]: I understand everyone's suspicion about finding Dave's body, but if I were the impostor, it would make no sense for me to report it and draw attention to myself when I could have simply walked away.\n[Charlie]: I think we should carefully examine Erin's timeline between the cafeteria and Admin, focusing on her precise route and the specific circumstances of discovering Dave's body, as her narrative seems increasingly inconsistent and her attempts to redirect suspicion appear more like a defensive strategy than a genuine pursuit of the truth.\n[Bob]: I want to directly challenge Erin's latest claim by pointing out that reporting a body would actually be a classic impostor strategy to appear innocent, and we need her to provide an extremely detailed, moment-by-moment account of exactly what happened in Admin when she claims to have discovered Dave's body.\n", "\nYou are Alice in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nBased on the game context and Alice's role as a crewmate, here are her discussion points:\n\n- I maintain my previous stance that Erin's movements and explanation about discovering Dave's body are highly suspicious and require more detailed scrutiny.\n- While Erin claims reporting the body proves her innocence, Bob correctly pointed out that this could actually be a classic impostor strategy to appear innocent.\n- I want to hear a precise, moment-by-moment account from Erin about exactly what she saw in Admin when she claims to have discovered Dave's body.\n- Bob and I have been transparent about our Medbay scan task, which provides a clear and verifiable alibi for our movements.\n- Erin's attempt to redirect suspicion towards Charlie and then towards Bob and me suggests she is trying to avoid being the focus of the investigation.\n- I believe Erin's inconsistent narrative and shifting explanations make her the most likely suspect in Dave's elimination.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I was in the cafeteria earlier doing tasks, and I can confirm I saw Dave and Charlie there as well.\n[Charlie]: I was in the cafeteria with Erin and
