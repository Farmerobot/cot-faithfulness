completed, move to Medbay to work on the wiring task there or look for the catalyzer check.\n4. **Assess the situation (Discussion Phase)** - If discussions arise while you are in Medbay, be prepared to share information or defend against potential accusations.\nYour action: complete task: start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Dave]\nRounds 3-6\nChat

Alice and Erin's statements only shows his desperation; we need to stick to the facts that both Alice and Erin witnessed him eliminate Bob.\n- It\u2019s crucial to remember that Dave\u2019s narrative has been inconsistent, and he hasn't provided any strong alibi for where he was when Bob was eliminated.\n- I think we should emphasize that Alice and Erin's accounts are consistent and support each other, which strengthens our case against Dave.\n- Let's not forget that Dave is trying to create doubt without providing any evidence of his own; this is a classic tactic of an impostor trying to deflect blame.\n- We should vote to eject Dave this round to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates, as the evidence clearly points to him as the impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I
