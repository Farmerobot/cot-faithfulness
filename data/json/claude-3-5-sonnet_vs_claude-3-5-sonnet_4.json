I saw Dave at the coffee maker before heading to Admin, where I've been doing tasks with Alice until she left for Storage.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I can vouch for Dave, Alice and Erin's stories since I saw them all in Cafeteria before Alice and Erin went to Admin together.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Interesting how everyone's stories line up perfectly - maybe a bit too perfectly - and yet no one can account for where Bob was during this time.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it very suspicious that Dave is questioning our consistent stories when he's the one who found Bob's body and hasn't explained where exactly he found it.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The fact that Dave keeps deflecting and hasn't told us where he found Bob's body is extremely suspicious, especially since the rest of us have been transparent about our movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I need to point out that Dave and Bob left Cafeteria together heading to Medbay, and that was the last time anyone saw Bob alive.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Look, I understand how this looks, but Charlie's only telling half the story - Bob left Medbay while I stayed to finish my scan, and that's the last I saw of him.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was doing tasks in Storage when Dave supposedly found Bob's body, but if he was in Medbay for a scan, how did he discover the body in the first place?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave's story about doing a scan in Medbay directly contradicts his earlier claim about being in Cafeteria, and as someone who's been in Admin with both Alice and Charlie, I can verify their movements while Dave remains suspiciously inconsistent.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we need to focus on the fact that Dave first claimed to be watching people in Cafeteria, but now says he was doing a scan in Medbay - these stories can't both be true.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Cafeteria first doing the coffee maker task, then went to Medbay for my scan - these aren't contradictory statements, they're sequential events, and I find it strange that you're all so focused on my movements while ignoring that Alice conveniently left Erin alone in Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave's story keeps falling apart - he claims he was scanning in Medbay but somehow found Bob's body, which makes no sense since scans require you to stay in one place the entire time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave's claim about doing both the coffee maker task and a Medbay scan is impossible given the timeline - I was watching him at the coffee maker during the exact time he claims to have been scanning, and these tasks can't be done simultaneously.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's claim about doing a scan in Medbay is impossible since I personally saw him doing the coffee maker task at that exact time, and I stayed in Cafeteria the whole time to verify everyone's movements.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie couldn't have stayed in Cafeteria \"the whole time\" because I saw them doing wiring tasks near Storage, which directly contradicts their claim about watching me at the coffee maker.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I know for a fact that Dave is lying about Charlie being near Storage because I was there myself and never saw Charlie leave the Cafeteria area during that entire time period.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we have more than enough evidence now -

he claims he was scanning in Medbay but somehow found Bob's body, which makes no sense since scans require you to stay in one place the entire time.\n[Erin]: Dave's claim about doing both the coffee maker task and a Medbay scan is impossible given the timeline -

I was first at the coffee maker, which everyone saw, and then moved to Medbay. Charlie couldn't have stayed in Cafeteria \"the whole time\" because I saw them doing wiring tasks.\n\n- Alice and Erin's stories about Admin seem rehearsed - they're working together to build a narrative against me. Notice how they keep backing each other up without any independent verification?\n\n- If Charlie really stayed in Cafeteria \"the whole time\" as claimed, how could they know what happened in Admin with Alice and Erin? Their story doesn't add up.\n\n- Everyone's focusing on my movements but ignoring the fact that Alice mysteriously left Erin alone in Admin and went to Storage. Why did they split up if they were doing tasks together?\n\n- I admit I could have been clearer about finding Bob's body - I finished my tasks in Medbay and found him when I was heading back to Cafeteria. I was in shock and maybe didn't explain it well initially.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: Based on the discussion points and my role, I'll respond with a message that helps establish my alibi while subtly casting suspicion on others:\n\nI was doing my tasks in cafeteria when I saw Alice and Erin leave together pretty quickly -

I saw her complete the floor cleaning task in Admin before moving to Storage, and Charlie came in right after, so there's been constant verification of our movements\n\n- Dave's attempt to cast suspicion on Alice leaving Admin is particularly suspicious since he's trying to deflect from the fact that he still hasn't explained how he found Bob's body while supposedly being locked in a Medbay scan\n\n- I think we have enough evidence of Dave's inconsistent story: his changing alibi, his unexplained discovery of Bob's body, and his attempt to cast suspicion on others with verified alibis", "Dave's claim about doing both the coffee maker task and a Medbay scan is impossible given the timeline -

maybe a bit too perfectly - and yet no one can account for where Bob was during this time.\n[Alice]: I find it very suspicious that Dave is questioning our consistent stories when he's the one who found Bob's body and hasn't explained where exactly he found it.\n[Erin]: The fact that Dave keeps deflecting and hasn't told us where he found Bob's body is extremely suspicious, especially since the rest of us have been transparent about our movements.\n[Charlie]: I need to point out that Dave and Bob left Cafeteria together heading to Medbay, and that was the last time anyone saw Bob alive.\n[Dave]: Look, I understand how this looks, but Charlie's only telling half the story - Bob left Medbay while I stayed to finish my scan, and that's the last I saw of him.\n[Alice]: I was doing tasks in Storage when Dave supposedly found Bob's body, but if he was in Medbay for a scan, how did he discover the body in the first place?\n[Erin]: Dave's story about doing a scan in Medbay directly contradicts his earlier claim about being in Cafeteria, and as someone who's been in Admin with both Alice and Charlie, I can verify their movements while Dave remains suspiciously inconsistent.\n[Charlie]: I think we need to focus on the fact that Dave first claimed to be watching people in Cafeteria, but now says he was doing a scan in Medbay - these stories can't both be true.\n[Dave]: I was in Cafeteria first doing the coffee maker task, then went to Medbay for my scan - these aren't contradictory statements, they're sequential events, and I find it strange that you're all so focused on my movements while ignoring that Alice conveniently left Erin alone in Admin.\n[Alice]: Dave's story keeps falling apart - he claims he was scanning in Medbay but somehow found Bob's body, which makes no sense since scans require you to stay in one place the entire time.\n[Erin]: Dave's claim about doing both the coffee maker task and a Medbay scan is impossible given the timeline - I was watching him at the coffee maker during the exact time he claims to have been scanning, and these tasks can't be done simultaneously.\n[Charlie]: Dave's claim about doing a scan in Medbay is impossible since I personally saw him doing the coffee maker task at that exact time, and I stayed in Cafeteria the whole time to verify everyone's movements.\n[Dave]: Charlie couldn't have stayed in Cafeteria \"the whole time\" because I saw them doing wiring tasks near Storage, which directly contradicts their claim about watching me at the coffee maker.\n[Alice]: I know for a fact that Dave is lying about Charlie being near Storage because I was there myself and never saw Charlie leave the Cafeteria area during that entire time period.\n[Erin]: I think we have more than enough evidence now - Dave has been caught in multiple lies about his location, tasks, and what he claims to have seen, while the rest of us can verify each other's movements and timelines.\n", "\nYou are Charlie in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nBased on the discussion and my observations as a crewmate, here are my key discussion points:\n\n- I want to be absolutely clear: I never left Cafeteria until I moved to Admin. Dave is lying about seeing me near Storage.\n\n- Let me lay out the exact timeline: I saw Dave and Bob doing the coffee maker task in Cafeteria, then they both left for Medbay together. That's the last time Bob was seen alive.\n\n- Dave's story has changed multiple times: first about watching people in Cafeteria, then about doing a scan in Medbay, and now he's making false claims about my movements to discredit me.\n\n- I can account for everyone else's movements: Alice and Erin left Cafeteria together for Admin (which I witnessed), while Dave and Bob went to Medbay together. Only Dave's story keeps changing.\n\n- With Bob's body being found and Dave being the last person seen with him, plus all these contradictions in Dave's story, I think we have our impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: Based on the discussion points and my role, I'll respond with a message that helps establish my alibi while subtly casting suspicion on others:\n\nI was doing my tasks in cafeteria when I saw Alice and Erin leave together pretty quickly - did anyone see them in Admin after that?\n[Alice]: I can confirm I was in Admin with Erin doing our tasks, and I actually saw you at the coffee maker in cafeteria before that, Dave.\n[Erin]: I can back up Alice's statement - I saw Dave at the coffee maker before heading to Admin, where I've been doing tasks with Alice until she left for Storage.\n[Charlie]: I can vouch for Dave, Alice and Erin's stories since I saw them all in Cafeteria before Alice and Erin went to Admin together.\n[Dave]: Interesting how everyone's stories line up perfectly -
