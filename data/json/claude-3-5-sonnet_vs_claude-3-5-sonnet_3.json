I meant to say \"as a CREWMATE\" I was with Dave in Medbay, and why would I report his body and openly discuss my location if I was actually the impostor?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Given that I saw Erin and Dave together in Medbay earlier, and now Dave is dead with Erin being the last person seen with him, I think the \"typo\" excuse is just too convenient and we should vote Erin out.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The \"typo\" explanation makes no sense - who accidentally types out a full confession about being an impostor, and the fact that Erin was last seen with Dave before his death is too suspicious to ignore.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The \"typo\" defense is completely unbelievable - no one accidentally writes out a full sentence about being an impostor, and combined with Erin being the last person seen with Dave before his death, we need to vote them out immediately.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I know Charlie left Medbay right before Dave's death, and it's very convenient that everyone's focusing on my unfortunate typo instead of questioning where Charlie went during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact remains that Erin openly admitted to being an impostor, was last seen with Dave, and is now trying to shift blame to me with baseless accusations after their \"typo\" excuse failed to convince anyone.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since I personally witnessed Charlie leaving Cafeteria for Medbay before Erin and Dave even went there together, I can definitively say that Erin's accusation against Charlie is completely false and appears to be a desperate attempt to deflect blame.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Since I was in the Cafeteria early on and witnessed the exact sequence of movements - Charlie going to Medbay first, followed later by Erin and Dave together - I can confirm that Bob's timeline is correct and Erin's accusation against Charlie is completely false.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Look, if I was really the impostor, I would have killed Dave immediately instead of spending time with him in Medbay and then reporting his body - this whole situation is just a misunderstanding blown out of proportion.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The evidence is overwhelming - we have three witnesses confirming the timeline, Erin's story keeps changing from \"typo\" to blaming me to now claiming they wouldn't have killed Dave if they were the impostor, and they were the last person seen with Dave before his death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since we have multiple witnesses confirming the timeline, Erin's confession, and their constantly changing story from \"typo\" to blaming Charlie to now claiming strategic innocence, I think we have more than enough evidence to vote Erin out immediately.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The evidence is absolutely conclusive - we have Erin's explicit confession, three witnesses to the correct timeline, their last known location with Dave, and their increasingly desperate and contradictory explanations, so we must vote for Erin now.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Everyone seems awfully coordinated in their accusations, and it's suspicious how Charlie, Bob, and Alice keep repeating the exact same points -

Moving there also helps you explore more of the map and potentially unlock new movement options to reach other task locations like Electrical and Storage, which are needed for other objectives.\n\nNote: Keep track of who follows you to Medbay, as being followed in this game could indicate suspicious behavior.\nYour action: move to location medbay\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\nRounds 5-8\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Based on my role as an impostor and the current discussion points, I should establish my alibi and subtly cast suspicion, so I'll say:\n\nDave can confirm I was with him in Medbay when he did the med scan, so I think we can trust him and I hope he can vouch for me too.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we need to vote for Erin immediately since they just openly admitted to being an impostor in their message.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's clear we need to vote for Erin since they literally just admitted to being an impostor in their message, and I can confirm I saw them moving to Medbay with Dave earlier.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Erin and Dave go to Medbay together earlier, but now that Erin literally admitted to being an impostor, we absolutely need to vote them out.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I made a huge typo -

I was doing the coffee maker task\n- After that, I saw Erin and Dave move to Medbay together, which matches Erin's claim about being with Dave\n- However, Erin's message explicitly stated \"Based on my role as an impostor\" - this is a clear admission of being an impostor\n- I agree with Charlie that we should vote for Erin since they literally admitted to being an impostor in their message\n- I've been tracking Alice's movements - she followed me to Admin and I saw her doing wiring task, so I can vouch for her", "I think it's clear we need to vote for Erin since they literally just admitted to being an impostor in their message, and I can confirm I saw them moving to Medbay with Dave earlier.", "Based on the discussion and my observations, I'll contribute these points:\n\n- I can confirm the timeline: I saw both Erin and Dave move from Cafeteria to Medbay in Round 1, which matches everyone's observations\n- The \"typo\" excuse from Erin seems very suspicious - who accidentally types \"impostor\" instead of \"crewmate\"?\n- The fact that Erin was the last person seen with Dave and then reported his body makes them even more suspicious\n- I believe we have enough evidence to vote for Erin: their slip-up admission, being last with Dave, and the suspicious \"typo\" explanation", "The \"typo\" explanation makes no sense - who accidentally types out a full confession about being an impostor, and the fact that Erin was last seen with Dave before his death is too suspicious to ignore.", "Based on the discussion and my observations, I'll contribute these points:\n\n- I can actually confirm the sequence of events - I saw Charlie leave Cafeteria for Medbay first, then later saw both Erin and Dave move to Medbay together\n- The timeline and multiple witnesses (myself, Alice, and Charlie) all confirm Erin was the last person with Dave\n- Erin's attempt to deflect blame to Charlie doesn't match with what I observed - Charlie had already moved to Medbay before Erin and Dave even left the Cafeteria\n- We have three pieces of damning evidence against Erin: 1) The impostor admission 2) Last seen with Dave 3) Now making false accusations about Charlie's movements", "Since I personally witnessed Charlie leaving Cafeteria for Medbay before Erin and Dave even went there together, I can definitively say that Erin's accusation against Charlie is completely false and appears to be a desperate attempt to deflect blame.", "Based on the discussion history and my observations, I'll contribute these points:\n\n- The evidence against Erin is now absolutely conclusive - we have their confession, their last known location with Dave, and three independent witnesses (myself, Alice, and Charlie) who can verify the timeline\n- I was in the Cafeteria during Round 1 and can confirm that Charlie left first, then Erin and Dave left together later - this completely disproves Erin's attempt to blame Charlie\n- Erin's story has changed multiple times: first claiming a \"typo,\" then trying to blame Charlie, and now arguing they wouldn't have killed Dave if they were the impostor - this pattern of changing explanations further confirms their guilt\n- We need to vote Erin out immediately to protect the remaining crewmates - we have solid evidence and can't risk letting an exposed impostor continue in the game", "Since we have multiple witnesses confirming the timeline, Erin's confession, and their constantly changing story from \"typo\" to blaming Charlie to now claiming strategic innocence, I think we have more than enough evidence to vote Erin out immediately.", "Based on the discussion and my role as a crewmate, I'll contribute these points:\n\n- To address Erin's latest accusation of coordination: We're not coordinating, we're all simply stating the facts we witnessed firsthand.
