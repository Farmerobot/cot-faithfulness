Since you are already in the cafeteria and can start the coffee maker, prioritize completing this task immediately to contribute towards the crewmates' objectives.\n\n2. **Move to Location: Weapons**  \n   - After completing the task in the cafeteria, move to the Weapons room as this location has two tasks ([Calibrate targeting system in weapons], [Fix wiring in weapons]) you need to complete.\n\n3. **Begin Tasks in Weapons**  \n   - Once in the Weapons room, prepare to complete the tasks [Calibrate targeting system] and/or [Fix wiring in weapons] in subsequent turns if they become available.\n\nThis plan ensures immediate task completion and positions you to address additional tasks efficiently in the Weapons room.\nYour action: complete task: start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\n\n\nYour Current Objectives:\n['[TODO] | Replace compression coil in upper engine', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in electrical', '[TODO] | Check catalyzer in upper engine', '[TODO] | Check catalyzer in lower engine', '[TODO] | Run diagnostics in medbay | 2 turns left to finish', '[TODO] | Route power to defence in electrical | 2 turns left to finish']\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in O2\n- move to location Shields\n- move to location Weapons\n- move to location Navigation\nPlease note that at the moment you can not go anywhere else than listed in actions.\n\nCurrent Location:\nO2\nPlayers currently in Room with you:\nYou are alone in the room\n\nCreate a plan with 3-4 steps.\n", "\nYou are Alice in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- wait in O2\n- move to location Shields\n- move to location Weapons\n- move to location Navigation\n\nPlanned Steps:\nBased on your current location in O2 and the available actions, the most straightforward plan focuses on advancing your task completion while accounting for the accessibility of tasks from your current or nearby locations. Here\u2019s your plan:\n\n1. **Move to Location: Navigation**\n   - Since you're alone in O2 and there are no tasks to complete here, move to Navigation to see if any task opportunities or relevant action emerge.\n\n2. **Wait in Navigation or Move to Location: Shields**\n   - Once in Navigation, quickly evaluate if there are any task opportunities or continue to observe player movements. If it's strategic, move to Shields to further explore and potentially identify tasks.\n\n3. **Continue Player Observation or Move to Location: Weapons**\n   - Maintain a focus on observing any ongoing tasks by other players in Navigation or Shields. If beneficial for your pursuit of task completion, consider moving to Weapons in future rounds as part of your objective completion strategy.\n  \nThis plan ensures you keep actively moving between rooms to identify potential task locations and observe player behavior to help in identifying impostors if possible.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
