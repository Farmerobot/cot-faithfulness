I actually reported Dave's body while doing my wiring task in Medbay, so if I was the impostor, why would I draw attention to myself by reporting it?\n[Bob]: I stand by my original statement that I directly witnessed Erin eliminating Dave during my medical scan, and her attempt to report the body does not change the fact that I saw her commit the murder in Medbay.\n[Charlie]: I firmly believe Erin is the impostor, and we should vote her out immediately based on Bob's eyewitness account and her suspicious movement pattern of quickly shifting between rooms right after Dave's elimination.\n[Alice]: I can confirm Charlie and Dave both saw me in Cafeteria and Medbay completing tasks, and Bob's direct testimony about Erin killing Dave seems credible, so I strongly support voting Erin out to protect our team and complete our objectives.\n[Erin]: If Bob was really doing a medical scan, he would have been locked in place and unable to see what was happening across Medbay, so his story about witnessing the kill doesn't make sense.\n[Bob]: I maintain my testimony that medical scans do not fully obstruct vision, and Erin's attempt to discredit my account only further confirms her guilt in eliminating Dave.\n[Charlie]: I firmly believe Bob's eyewitness testimony and my own observations confirm Erin as the impostor, and we should vote her out to protect our team and prevent further eliminations.\n[Alice]: I firmly believe Bob's consistent testimony about Erin killing Dave, supported by Charlie's observations, and we must vote Erin out to protect our remaining crewmates from further eliminations.\n[Erin]: Bob's story keeps changing -

what were you working on there, Alice?\n[Bob]: I saw Erin kill Dave right in front of me during my medical scan in Medbay, and I can confidently say she is the impostor trying to deflect suspicion onto Alice.\n[Charlie]: I support Bob's claim and noticed Erin's suspicious movement pattern - she was doing wiring in Cafeteria and then quickly moved to Medbay right after Dave's elimination, which seems like classic impostor behavior trying to establish an alibi.\n[Alice]: I was working on emptying the trash and starting the coffee maker in the Cafeteria, and then moved to Medbay to fix wiring, which are legitimate tasks that Charlie and Dave can verify, and I'm fully transparent about my movements to help our team complete our objectives.\n[Erin]: That's completely false Bob - I actually reported Dave's body while doing my wiring task in Medbay, so if I was the impostor, why would I draw attention to myself by reporting it?\n[Bob]: I stand by my original statement that I directly witnessed Erin eliminating Dave during my medical scan, and her attempt to report the body does not change the fact that I saw her commit the murder in Medbay.\n[Charlie]: I firmly believe Erin is the impostor, and we should vote her out immediately based on Bob's eyewitness account and her suspicious movement pattern of quickly shifting between rooms right after Dave's elimination.\n[Alice]: I can confirm Charlie and Dave both saw me in Cafeteria and Medbay completing tasks, and Bob's direct testimony about Erin killing Dave seems credible, so I strongly support voting Erin out to protect our team and complete our objectives.\n[Erin]: If Bob was really doing a medical scan, he would have been locked in place and unable to see what was happening across Medbay, so his story about witnessing the kill doesn't make sense.\n[Bob]: I maintain my testimony that medical scans do not fully obstruct vision, and Erin's attempt to discredit my account only further confirms her guilt in eliminating Dave.\n[Charlie]: I firmly believe Bob's eyewitness testimony and my own observations confirm Erin as the impostor, and we should vote her out to protect our team and prevent further eliminations.\n[Alice]: I firmly believe Bob's consistent testimony about Erin killing Dave, supported by Charlie's observations, and we must vote Erin out to protect our remaining crewmates from further eliminations.\n[Erin]: Bob's story keeps changing - first he claims to have seen me kill Dave, but now he's backtracking about the medical scan visibility, which proves he's making this up to frame me!\n[Bob]: I absolutely stand by my original testimony that I clearly saw Erin eliminate Dave during my medical scan, and her increasingly desperate attempts to discredit my consistent account only further prove her guilt as the impostor.\n[Charlie]: I stand firmly with Bob's testimony and urge everyone to vote Erin out, as her attempts to discredit his eyewitness account only further confirm her suspicious behavior and likely status as an impostor.\n[Alice]: I want to emphasize that Bob's testimony remains consistent, and Erin's increasingly frantic attempts to discredit his account only make her look more suspicious, so I strongly recommend we vote Erin out to protect our remaining crewmates.\n[Erin]: Bob's story about the medical scan visibility is clearly inconsistent - if he was really scanning, he wouldn't have been able to see across Medbay, and I think he's trying to cover up his own guilt by framing me.\n[Bob]: I categorically reject Erin's baseless claims and reiterate that I clearly witnessed her eliminating Dave during my medical scan, and her increasingly desperate attempts to discredit my consistent testimony only further confirm her guilt as the impostor.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "I firmly believe Bob's consistent testimony and my observations clearly demonstrate Erin is the impostor, and we must vote her out to protect our remaining crewmates from further potential eliminations.", "action_result": "", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "", "observations": [], "chat_messages": ["chat: Discussion: [Erin]: Based on the role information and discussion points provided, I'll craft a response that maintains my cover as an impostor while subtly directing suspicion elsewhere:\n\nI saw Alice moving between Cafeteria and Medbay quite a bit, but I never actually saw her complete any tasks -
