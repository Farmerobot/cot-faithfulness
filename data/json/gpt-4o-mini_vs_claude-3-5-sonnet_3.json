they should be held accountable for their claims about Charlie's whereabouts.\n- We need to consider the possibility that Bob and Erin could be working together to frame me; their coordinated defense makes it suspicious, and they seem to be shifting the focus onto me to cover their tracks.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I think it would be beneficial for us to share what tasks we've completed so far to establish alibis, as I've noticed Erin and Dave were together in Weapons, which could give them an advantage if anything suspicious happened there.\n[Bob]: I can confirm seeing Erin and Dave in Weapons earlier, and I also observed Alice completing tasks in the Cafeteria, so I think we should focus our attention on players whose movements we haven't been able to verify yet.\n[Erin]: Since we're discussing task completion, I can verify seeing Bob doing multiple tasks in both O2 and Shields, and I also saw Charlie successfully completing the asteroids task in Weapons.\n[Dave]: I agree with Alice's suggestion and can confirm seeing her and Erin in Cafeteria early on, plus I witnessed both Charlie and Erin completing the asteroids task in Weapons, which gives me confidence in their innocence.\n[Alice]: I just found Charlie's body in Admin, and since I was alone there, it raises questions about who was around him last\u2014did anyone see him leave Weapons before heading to Admin?\n[Bob]: I last saw Charlie in O2 with Erin and Dave, which seems crucial since his body was found in Admin\u2014someone must have followed him from O2.\n[Erin]: Given that I saw Charlie in O2 with Bob and Dave, and I was in Shields and Storage afterward without seeing Charlie pass through, I think we need to carefully examine who had the opportunity to follow Charlie to Admin without being seen.\n[Dave]: I need to be clear about my movements - after seeing Charlie in O2, I went the opposite direction towards Navigation and Shields, so I couldn't have followed him to Admin, and I can prove my path since multiple people saw me in those locations.\n[Alice]: I find it interesting that Bob claims to have seen Charlie in O2, yet neither he nor Erin noticed him leave that area\u2014this could indicate a potential cover-up, so we should definitely keep an eye on both of them.\n[Bob]: Given that Alice found Charlie's body in Admin where she was alone, and she's now trying to cast suspicion on me despite my clear movements from O2 to Communications, I think we need to seriously consider that she might be the impostor attempting to deflect attention.\n[Erin]: I think Alice's behavior is highly suspicious - she was alone in Admin where Charlie's body was found, and now she's trying to deflect attention by casting doubt on both Bob and me despite our verifiable movements and task completions.\n[Dave]: Given that Alice was alone in Admin where Charlie's body was found and is now trying to cast suspicion on players with verified alibis, I strongly believe we should focus our investigation on her as the likely impostor.\n[Alice]: I find it concerning that both Bob and Erin are so quick to defend themselves while failing to provide solid proof of their movements;

Since Weapons is directly accessible from your current location and you need to clear asteroids there, that should be the priority.\n\nHere's your 3-step plan:\n\n1. Move to Weapons since it's immediately accessible and you have a time-sensitive task there\n2. Start clearing asteroids in Weapons to prevent the task from expiring\n3. Stay in Weapons to complete the asteroid clearing task (since it likely requires multiple turns)\n\nThis plan prioritizes the time-sensitive asteroid clearing task while it's still accessible. While you have another time-sensitive task in Electrical, you currently don't have a path to reach that location, so we'll need to address that when movement options change.\nYour action: move to location weapons\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\n\n\nYour Current Objectives:\n['[TODO] | Replace compression coil in upper engine', '[TODO] | Clean the floor in admin', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in electrical', '[TODO] | Check catalyzer in lower engine', '[TODO] | Replace compression coil in lower engine', '[TODO] | Route power to attack in electrical | 2 turns left to finish']\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Cafeteria\n- move to location Medbay\n- move to location Admin\n- move to location Weapons\nPlease note that at the moment you can not go anywhere else than listed in actions.\n\nCurrent Location:\nCafeteria\nPlayers currently in Room with you:\nYou are alone in the room\n\nCreate a plan with 3-4 steps.\n", "\nYou are Charlie in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- wait in Cafeteria\n- move to location Medbay\n- move to location Admin\n- move to location Weapons\n\nPlanned Steps:\nBased on your current location in Cafeteria and your available actions, let's analyze the situation:\n\n1. You have a time-sensitive task in Electrical (Route power to attack) with only 2 turns left\n2. Your current movement options are limited to Medbay, Admin, or Weapons\n3. You have a cleaning task in Admin that could be accessed now\n\nHere's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1. Move to Admin since it's directly accessible and you have a task there (Clean the floor)\n2. Start cleaning the floor in Admin while waiting for paths to other locations to open up\n3. Watch for paths to Electrical to open up in the next round, as you need to complete the time-sensitive power routing task\n\nThis plan makes the best use of your current movement options while working toward completing objectives. While you have a time-sensitive task in Electrical, there's currently no path to reach it, so we'll focus on an accessible task in Admin instead.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

Her trying to use this normal circumstance as suspicious behavior seems like deflection.\n\n- The fact that Alice was alone in Admin where Charlie's body was found, and is now trying to cast doubt on multiple players with verified alibis, strongly suggests she's the impostor trying to create confusion.\n\n- Both Dave and Bob can verify my locations and activities throughout the game, while Alice has been mostly alone and unaccounted for.

Her trying to use this normal circumstance as suspicious behavior seems like deflection.\n\n- The fact that Alice was alone in Admin where Charlie's body was found, and is now trying to cast doubt on multiple players with verified alibis, strongly suggests she's the impostor trying to create confusion.\n\n- Both Dave and Bob can verify my locations and activities throughout the game, while Alice has been mostly alone and unaccounted for.

Their stories align perfectly with my observations.\n\n- Alice's strategy of questioning why we didn't see Charlie leave O2 seems like a desperate attempt to create confusion, as we were all focused on our own tasks and movements at that time.\n\n- Given all the evidence - Alice being alone at the crime scene, her attempts to discredit verified alibis, and her increasingly defensive behavior - I strongly believe we should vote for Alice.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I think it would be beneficial for us to share what tasks we've completed so far to establish alibis, as I've noticed
