It's important to establish alibis, and I'm happy to answer any further questions about my whereabouts.\n\n-  Since Erin was in Medbay, her testimony about activity near that area is vital.  Any unusual sightings or sounds could be relevant.  Let's hear more from Erin.\n\n-  The fact that several of us were in the cafeteria doing tasks makes it harder to pinpoint the killer, but that doesn't mean we can't find clues.  Let's keep focusing on the details Dave provided.\n\n-  It's possible the killer came from another room and quickly escaped.

Medbay is also nearby, ensuring you can act quickly on potential further developments.\n\n2. **Fix wiring in Medbay** - Once you arrive in Medbay, focus on completing the wiring task. This progresses the crewmate goal of completing tasks and provides you a strong alibi if questioned.\n\n3. **Submit scan in Medbay** - After wiring, if the time allows, submit the scan. This continues to contribute to task completion and provides further proof of your crewmate status.\n\nThis plan focuses on task completion while taking advantage of opportunities in your immediate vicinity, and positions you well for the future rounds.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
