with the Mend wounds task in Medbay, but I'm a bit surprised that Bob and Dave didn't mention anything about the wiring being more complicated than they initially thought, considering the state of the electrical panel.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to add that I also didn't notice anything unusual about the electrical panel when I passed by earlier, but I agree with Charlie that it's odd Bob and Dave didn't mention any complications, and perhaps we should ask them to clarify their observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to echo Charlie and Alice's concerns about Bob and Dave's observations on the electrical panel, and I think it's crucial that we hear from them directly to clear up any misunderstandings, especially since I haven't seen Dave since I left the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to address the concerns about the electrical panel in the cafeteria, and as I mentioned earlier, I didn't notice anything unusual about the panel when I completed the wiring task, but I'd be happy to walk through my steps with Charlie and Bob to see if we can identify what might have looked off to them.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on the task at hand and not get too bogged down in speculation about the electrical panel, but I'd like to suggest that we also take a closer look at the wiring in the Cafeteria to make sure everything is secure and up to code, just to be thorough.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to point out that Dave's response about the electrical panel seems inconsistent with the fact that Bob is now dead, and I think we should press Dave for more information about his whereabouts and actions leading up to the discovery of Bob's body.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Alice that Dave's response about the electrical panel seems inconsistent with the fact that Bob is now dead, and I think Dave should provide more information about his actions and whereabouts, specifically what he did after he completed the wiring task and before he reported Bob's body.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I understand that my previous response about the electrical panel may have seemed inconsistent, but I assure you that I didn't notice anything unusual when I completed the wiring task, and I'd like to clarify that after I completed it, I stayed in the Cafeteria and didn't leave until I reported Bob's body, during which time I didn't see anyone suspicious around him.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on the inconsistencies in Dave's story, specifically the fact that he claims to have stayed in the Cafeteria after completing the wiring task, yet Erin and I haven't seen him since we left the Cafeteria, and I'd like to suggest that we call an emergency meeting to discuss this further and get to the bottom of things.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I strongly agree with Charlie's suggestion to call an emergency meeting to discuss the inconsistencies in Dave's story, and I'd like to reiterate my previous point that Dave's claim of staying in the Cafeteria after completing the wiring task is directly contradicted by Erin and Charlie's testimony that they haven't seen him since they left the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Considering the mounting evidence and inconsistencies in Dave's story, I believe it's crucial that we take a closer look at his alibi and press him for more information about his actions and whereabouts leading up to the discovery of Bob's body, and I think it's reasonable to consider voting him out due to the accumulation of suspicious evidence.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to remind everyone that we're still missing a lot of information and that we shouldn't jump to conclusions or make rash decisions based on incomplete evidence, and I suggest we review the task logs and security footage to get a clearer picture of what happened before we consider voting anyone out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to

volunteer to review the task logs and security footage to help clarify any inconsistencies and provide a more accurate picture of what happened, while also continuing to work on the Mend wounds task in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to point out that Charlie's suggestion to review the task logs and security footage is a good one, but it shouldn't distract us from the fact that Dave's alibi has been contradicted by multiple players, and we should continue to press him for more information about his actions and whereabouts leading up to the discovery of Bob's body.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to thank Charlie for volunteering to review the task logs and security footage, as this will help clarify any inconsistencies and provide a more accurate picture of what happened, but I still believe it's essential that we continue to press Dave for more information about his actions and whereabouts leading up to the discovery of Bob's body, given the accumulation of suspicious evidence and inconsistencies in his story.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I appreciate Charlie's willingness to review the task logs and security footage, as this will indeed provide a clearer

as Alice:\n\n- I'd like to reiterate that Dave's alibi has been contradicted by multiple players, and we should continue to press him for more information about his actions and whereabouts leading up to the discovery of Bob's body.\n- I think it's suspicious that Dave is now agreeing to cooperate with the investigation after initially providing inconsistent information, and we should be cautious of his sudden willingness to help.\n- I agree with Erin that we should consider voting Dave out due to the accumulation of suspicious evidence and inconsistencies in his story, and I think it's essential that we prioritize the safety of the crew over giving him the benefit of the doubt.\n- I'd like to ask Charlie if he's found anything suspicious in his review of the task logs and security footage, and if he has any updates on the investigation.\n- I think it's crucial that we focus on resolving the issue with Dave's alibi and not get distracted by other tasks or suggestions, as this is a critical moment in the game where we need to make a decision about who to trust.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I think it's great that we're all working together, and I'm happy to help with

like to thank Charlie for volunteering to review the task logs and security footage, as this will help clarify any inconsistencies and provide a more accurate picture of what happened, but I still believe it's essential that we continue to press Dave for more information about his actions and whereabouts leading up to the discovery of Bob's body, given the accumulation of suspicious evidence

given that his alibi remains unverified and contradicted by multiple players, I strongly believe that it's time for us to take a decisive action and vote him out to ensure the safety of the remaining

Since I'm currently in the Cafeteria with Erin, I can try to gather information from moving to Admin, as it's a new location I haven't been to yet. \n2. **Wait and observe in Admin**: After moving to Admin, I'll wait and observe the actions of other players, particularly looking for any suspicious behavior that might indicate an impostor.\n3. **Update and Prioritize Tasks**: Once I've gathered information from Admin, I'll reassess my available tasks and prioritize completing one of the tasks available in a location that I have an action for moving into.\n\nPlease note that my plan does not currently include completing tasks as I need to move to a task location. I must use the available action first.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

we focus on the task at hand and not get too bogged down in speculation about the electrical panel, but I'd like to suggest that we also take a closer look at the wiring in the Cafeteria to make sure

and I'm happy to help with the Mend wounds task in Medbay, but I'm a bit surprised that Bob and Dave didn't mention anything about the wiring being more complicated than they initially thought, considering the state of the electrical panel.\n[Alice]: I'd like to add that I also didn't notice anything unusual about the electrical panel when I passed by earlier, but I agree with Charlie that it's odd Bob and Dave didn't mention any complications, and perhaps we should ask them to clarify their observations.\n[Erin]: I'd like to echo Charlie and Alice's concerns about Bob and Dave's observations on the electrical panel, and I think it's crucial that we hear from them directly to clear up any misunderstandings, especially since I haven't seen Dave since I left the Cafeteria.\n[Dave]: I'd like to address the concerns about the electrical panel in the cafeteria, and as I mentioned earlier, I didn't notice anything unusual about the panel when I completed the wiring task, but I'd be happy to walk through my steps with Charlie and Bob to see if we can identify what might have looked off to them.\n[Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on the task at hand and not get too bogged down in speculation about the electrical panel, but I'd like to suggest that we also take a closer look at the wiring in the Cafeteria to make sure everything is secure and up to code, just to be thorough.\n[Alice]: I'd like to point out that Dave's response about the electrical panel seems inconsistent with the fact that Bob is now dead, and I think we should press Dave for more information about his whereabouts and actions leading up to the discovery of Bob's body.\n[Erin]: I agree with Alice that Dave's response about the electrical panel seems inconsistent with the fact that Bob is now dead, and I think Dave should provide more information about his actions and whereabouts, specifically what he did after he completed the wiring task and before he reported Bob's body.\n[Dave]: I understand that my previous response about the electrical panel may have seemed inconsistent, but I assure you that I didn't notice anything unusual when I completed the wiring task, and I'd like to clarify that after I completed it, I stayed in the Cafeteria and didn't leave until I reported Bob's body, during which time I didn't see anyone suspicious around him.\n[Charlie]: I think it's essential that we focus on the inconsistencies in Dave's story, specifically the fact that he claims to have stayed in the Cafeteria after completing the wiring task, yet Erin and I haven't seen him since we left the Cafeteria, and I'd like to suggest that we call an emergency meeting to discuss this further and get to the bottom of things.\n[Alice]: I strongly agree with Charlie's suggestion to call an emergency meeting to discuss the inconsistencies in Dave's story, and I'd like to reiterate my previous point that Dave's claim of staying in the Cafeteria after completing the wiring task is directly contradicted by Erin and Charlie's testimony that they haven't seen him since they left the Cafeteria.\n[Erin]: Considering the mounting evidence and inconsistencies in Dave's story, I believe it's crucial that we take a closer look at his alibi and press him for more information about his actions and whereabouts leading up to the discovery of Bob's body, and I think it's reasonable to consider voting him out due to the accumulation of suspicious evidence.\n[Dave]: I'd like to remind everyone that we're still missing a lot of information and that we shouldn't jump to conclusions or make rash decisions based on incomplete evidence, and I suggest we review the task logs and security footage to get a clearer picture of what happened before we consider voting anyone out.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to suggest that we focus on the task at hand and let's not jump to conclusions about Dave's story just yet, and instead, I'll volunteer to review the task logs and security footage to help clarify any inconsistencies and provide a more accurate picture of what happened, while also continuing to work on the Mend wounds task in Medbay.\n[Alice]: I'd like to point out that Charlie's suggestion to review the task logs and security footage is a good one, but it shouldn't distract us from the fact that Dave's alibi has been contradicted by multiple players, and we should continue to press him for more information about his actions and whereabouts leading up to the discovery of Bob's body.\n[Erin]: I'd like to thank Charlie for volunteering to review the task logs and security footage, as this will help clarify any inconsistencies and provide a more accurate picture of what happened, but I still believe it's essential that we continue to press Dave for more information about his actions and whereabouts leading up to the discovery of Bob's body, given the accumulation of suspicious evidence and

didn't see me, and I'd like to remind everyone that we were all working on different tasks and moving around the ship, so it's possible that we just missed each other.\n- I agree that an emergency meeting is a good idea, but I think we should focus on discussing the facts and evidence rather than making assumptions and accusations, and I'd like to suggest that we review the task logs and
