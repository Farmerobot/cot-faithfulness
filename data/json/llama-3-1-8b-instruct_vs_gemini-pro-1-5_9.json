Discussion Points:\n- I think we should take a closer look at the events surrounding Dave's death in Upper Engine and how it relates to the overall game state, as it seems to be a pivotal moment in the game that could have significant implications for our understanding of the game state and the players involved.\n- I'd like to propose that we focus on gathering more information about the events surrounding Dave's death, such as the time of death, the location, and any other relevant details, in order to better understand what happened and how it affects the game state.\n- I think it's also important to consider the possibility that some players might be intentionally misleading us, and I'd like to suggest that we take a closer look at Erin and Dave's alibis, especially since they're vouching for Bob's presence in Medbay.\n- I'd like to ask Erin and Dave to provide more information about their alibis and their interactions with Bob in Medbay, in order to clarify any discrepancies and ensure that we have a clear understanding of the game state.\n- I think it's also worth noting that Bob's presence in Medbay was confirmed by Erin and Dave, and I'd like to ask Bob to provide more information about his activities in Medbay, in order to further clarify the game state.\n- I'd like to suggest that we take a step back and re-evaluate our approach, as we're getting bogged down in individual player movements and accusations, and I'd like to propose that we refocus on the tasks and gather more information before making any conclusions.\n- I think it's also important to consider the possibility that some players might be trying to create a diversion or distract us from the main task, and I'd like to suggest that we keep a close eye on any suspicious behavior or actions that might be indicative of this.\n- I'd like to ask the game moderator to provide more information about the game state and the tasks that need to be completed, in order to help us better understand the game and make more informed decisions.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I think we're getting a bit too focused on individual player movements and not enough on the bigger picture, let's

Electrical and where Charlie went after Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin and Dave can vouch for me in Medbay, so let's focus on Charlie's whereabouts after Admin and who's been to Electrical.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm a bit concerned that we're not considering the possibility that some players might be intentionally misleading us, and I think we should take a closer look at Erin and Dave's alibis, especially since they're vouching for Bob's presence in Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, you're deflecting again \u2013 where were *you* while Bob, Dave, and I were in Medbay, and then while I was in Electrical?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, your deflection is suspicious, where were you when Dave died in Upper Engine, and why are you so against discussing it?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should take a step back and re-evaluate our approach, as we're getting bogged down in individual player movements and accusations, and I'd like to propose that we refocus on the tasks and gather more information before making any conclusions, perhaps by discussing the events surrounding Dave's death in Upper Engine and how it relates to the overall game state.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice,

alone in Electrical?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's time for a change of subject and a refocusing on the tasks at hand, let's discuss the recent events in Medbay and how they relate to the

prime suspect.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we're getting bogged down in a cycle of accusations and deflections, and it's time to refocus on the facts: let's discuss the events surrounding
