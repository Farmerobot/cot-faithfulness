since her entry into Medbay could provide insights into any potential inconsistencies.\n- It's crucial to note that Erin was seen in Medbay by me, and if Alice has a different account, it might indicate a discrepancy worth investigating further.\n- Perhaps we should also explore if anyone else can corroborate Alice's movements leading up to her arrival in Medbay, as this could help clarify the situation.\n- I suggest we focus on Alice's actions since her presence in Medbay is quite recent; this may reveal more about the timeline discrepancies surrounding Erin and Charlie's

her recent presence in Medbay could be key to resolving the discrepancies in Erin's reported locations.  Let's hear from Alice about her whereabouts during the relevant times.\n\n- To create a truly accurate timeline, we need specific times, not just general statements.  For example, instead of \"I saw Erin in Medbay,\" let's aim for \"I saw Erin in Medbay between 10:15 and 10:25.\" This level of detail will be crucial in identifying inconsistencies.\n\n- While we focus on the Erin/Medbay/Cafeteria discrepancy, let's not forget that Charlie was alone in Weapons for a long period.  Could this be a strategic move to avoid suspicion, or was he legitimately alone?  We need to consider all the observed behaviors.\n\n- My own timeline is readily available, and I'm happy to share the precise times and locations I was in to help us build this comprehensive timeline.  Let's aim for complete transparency to catch any inconsistencies.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I\u2019ve been in Medbay for a while now, and the only person I saw come in was Erin; it\u2019s strange that no one else has crossed my path, and I think we should discuss where everyone else has been to piece together our movements.\n[Dave]: I corroborate Bob's sighting of Erin in Medbay and have a detailed account of my own movements throughout the ship, including times when I was with Alice;

This might help piece together the overall picture.\n- Let's keep sharing our observations and try to correlate everyone's movements.  Pinpointing discrepancies is key to finding the imposter(s).", "I saw Erin in the cafeteria working on wiring earlier, and then I spent a considerable amount of time alone in Weapons afterward, so perhaps comparing our timelines with Bob and Dave's could help us identify any inconsistencies.", "- Let's focus on reconciling the conflicting reports about Erin's location.  My statement about seeing her in the cafeteria doesn't necessarily contradict Bob's account of seeing her in Medbay; she could have moved between locations.  We need more precise timestamps to determine if the sightings are truly incompatible.\n\n- I propose we each provide a detailed timeline of our movements, including specific times and locations, to eliminate any ambiguity.  This will help us identify any discrepancies and potential inconsistencies in our accounts.\n\n- While we investigate Erin's movements, let's also consider Alice's death.  Dave mentioned being with Alice; his account could provide crucial information about her last known location and any suspicious activity.  Dave, can you elaborate on your time with Alice?", "To clarify the conflicting Erin sightings, let's meticulously compare our detailed timelines, noting exact times and locations to pinpoint any inconsistencies.", "- I'm happy to share my detailed timeline to help resolve the discrepancies regarding Erin's location.  My memory is quite sharp, and I can recall specific times and locations.\n\n- Let's focus on creating a shared timeline, perhaps using timestamps if possible, to eliminate any ambiguity and pinpoint inconsistencies.  This will be the most effective way to identify any potential deception.\n\n- While I understand the suspicion around my account, I believe a thorough comparison of all our timelines is crucial before jumping to conclusions.  Let's avoid premature accusations and focus on objective evidence.\n\n- I suggest we each list our movements room by room, including approximate times, to make the comparison easier.  This will help us identify any overlaps or contradictions more efficiently.\n\n-  My goal is to find the imposter, and I believe a collaborative approach of sharing detailed timelines is the best way to achieve that.  Let's work together to solve this.", "To efficiently resolve the conflicting Erin sightings, let's systematically compare our detailed timelines, including precise times and locations, to identify any discrepancies and potential inconsistencies.", "- Let's create a shared timeline.  I can start: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Alice, and Dave (Round 1), then alone in Weapons (Rounds 2-3), then Navigation (Rounds 4-6), Weapons (Round 7), Navigation (Round 8), Weapons (Round 9), Navigation (Round 10), Weapons (Round 11), Navigation (Round 12), Weapons (Round 13), Navigation (Round 14), Weapons (Round 15), Navigation (Round 16).  Who wants to add their information?\n\n-  The discrepancy about Erin's location needs to be resolved.  My sighting of her in the Cafeteria doesn't contradict Bob and Dave's account if there was a time gap.  Let's focus on precise times to eliminate any confusion.\n\n- I agree with Bob that Alice's movements are important.  Knowing her location during the relevant times could help us understand the inconsistencies.  Alice, can you please share your timeline?\n\n-  Let's avoid accusations until we have a complete picture.  A thorough timeline comparison is the most effective way to find the Impostor.", "Let's focus on creating a precise timeline, noting the exact times we were in each location, to resolve the discrepancies regarding Erin's whereabouts and then analyze Alice's movements in relation to that timeline.", "- I agree that a precise timeline is crucial.  To help, I can confirm I saw Erin in the Cafeteria working on wiring early in the game.  After that, I was alone in Weapons for an extended period.
