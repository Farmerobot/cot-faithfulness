prioritize finishing the wiring task in the cafeteria, it's crucial we get it done efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I saw Alice doing the Empty the Cafeteria Trash task, so she seems to be working on tasks as well, and I agree we should focus on completing the wiring tasks quickly.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria, so we can check that off our list, and let's keep an eye on each other as we move to different rooms to complete our tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I saw Alice, Bob, and Dave working on tasks in the Cafeteria, so it seems like we're all focused on getting things done efficiently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still a bit concerned about Dave's disappearance, and I think we should take a closer look at Charlie's alibi, since they were the last one to mention seeing Dave, and we don't know what they were doing in the Admin room.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, where exactly did you find Dave's body, as I was in Admin alone and didn't see him there at all?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I found Dave's body right by the coffee task station in the cafeteria, and since Charlie was the last to leave, it would be helpful to know what task you were doing in Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, since you were the last to leave the cafeteria and didn't see Dave in Admin, can you clarify what task you were doing there, and if you noticed anyone else nearby?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on gathering more information about Dave's disappearance and Charlie's alibi, as it's crucial we understand what happened before we can move forward with our tasks and ensure everyone's safety on the ship.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Admin room working on the wiring task, and since I didn't see Dave or anyone else there, we should focus on those who were in the cafeteria to gather more insights on his disappearance.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's verify if anyone else saw Charlie in Admin to confirm his alibi, and make sure the wiring task he mentioned is actually completed there.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, can anyone else confirm seeing you working on the wiring task in Admin, as verifying your alibi would help us understand the situation better?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi and gathering more information about their activities in the Admin room, as it's crucial we understand their role in Dave's disappearance before we can trust their claims of working on the wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, since you found Dave's body by the coffee task station, did you see anyone else leaving that area or acting suspiciously before discovering the body?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I did not see anyone else leaving the coffee task station area before discovering Dave's body, so we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi and ensuring no one moved into the cafeteria unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Alice that verifying Charlie's alibi is crucial, so if anyone else saw Charlie in Admin, please speak up.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi by asking other players if they saw them in Admin, and if anyone has any information about Charlie's activities in the Admin room, please share it with us, as it's essential we understand their role in Dave's disappearance before we can trust their claims of working on the wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's not forget that multiple people were in the Cafeteria, where Dave's body was found, so we should focus on anyone who was in that area and might have seen something suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's ensure we verify if the wiring task in Admin is completed, as this would help confirm Charlie's alibi and clarify their role in Dave's disappearance.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Has anyone been in Admin recently to confirm if the wiring task is completed, as that would help verify Charlie's alibi and bring

working on tasks as well, and I agree we should focus on completing the wiring tasks quickly.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria, so we can check that off our list, and let's keep an eye on each other as we move to different rooms to complete our tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I saw Alice, Bob, and Dave working on tasks in the Cafeteria, so it seems like we're

bit concerned about Dave's disappearance, and I think we should take a closer look at Charlie's alibi, since they were the last one to mention seeing Dave, and we don't know what they were doing in the Admin room.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, where exactly did you find Dave's body, as I was in Admin alone and didn't see him there at all?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I found Dave's body right by the coffee task station in the cafeteria, and since Charlie was the last to leave, it would be helpful to know what task you were doing in Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, since you were the last to leave the cafeteria and didn't see Dave in Admin, can you clarify what task you were doing there, and if you noticed anyone else nearby?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to

happened before we can move forward with our tasks and ensure everyone's safety on the ship.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Admin room working on the wiring task, and since I didn't see Dave or anyone else there, we should focus on those who were in the cafeteria to gather more insights on his disappearance.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's verify if anyone else saw Charlie in Admin

discovering the body?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I did not see anyone else leaving the coffee task station area before discovering Dave's body, so we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi and

working on tasks as well, and I agree we should focus on completing the wiring tasks quickly.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria, so we can check that off our list,

bit concerned about Dave's disappearance, and I think we should take a closer look at Charlie's alibi, since they were the last one to mention seeing Dave, and we don't know what they were doing in

by the coffee task station in the cafeteria, and since Charlie was the last to leave, it would be helpful to know what task you were doing in Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, since you were

discovering the body?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I did not see anyone else leaving the coffee task station area before discovering Dave's body, so we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi and ensuring no one moved into the cafeteria unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Alice that verifying Charlie's alibi is crucial, so if anyone else saw Charlie in Admin, please speak up.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi by asking other players if they saw

trust their claims of working on the wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's not forget that multiple people were in the Cafeteria, where Dave's body was found, so we should focus on anyone

working on tasks as well, and I agree we should focus on completing the wiring tasks quickly.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria, so we can check that off our list,

bit concerned about Dave's disappearance, and I think we should take a closer look at Charlie's alibi, since they were the last one to mention seeing Dave, and we don't know what they were doing in the Admin room.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, where exactly did you find Dave's body, as I was in Admin alone and didn't see him there at all?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I found Dave's body right

happened before we can move forward with our tasks and ensure everyone's safety on the ship.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Admin room working on the wiring task, and since I didn't see

discovering the body?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I did not see anyone else leaving the coffee task station area before discovering Dave's body, so we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi and

Here's an adapted plan:\n\n1. **Wait in Cafeteria and Observe**: You will continue to wait in the Cafeteria and observe if any other crewmates enter the room. Given your current situation, this is the most straightforward action to take as it allows you to stay in the same location.\n\n2. **Create Deception or Redirect Suspicion**: Try to create a diversion to redirect suspicion from yourself to the remaining crew members. Although your current available actions seem limited, you might try to mention something from your previous conversations, express concern about their activities or alibis, or try to mislead them by pretending to have some crucial information. However, since your actions are extremely repetitive and don't provide any new choices, simply waiting for potential crew reactions can still be beneficial.\n\n3. **Mislead remaining crew members**: Since time is running out, your best bet is to mislead the remaining crew members with lies about Dave's disappearance. You could bring up a fairy tale-like explanation about 'Dave doing his thing,' 'He went out for some air,' or even some utterly unconvincing mystery theories of the room ringing (weather doesn't allow exits...

To achieve this, do the following:\n\n1. **Wait in Cafeteria**: This gives you time to think about the best course of action.\n2. **Pretend doing task: Empty the cafeteria trash**: Try to make it seem that you're working on an actual task to distract yourself and maintain a facade of productivity.\n3. **Pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria**: Continue pretending to be productive to maintain your alibi.\n4. **Manipulate Bob's game plan to aid your outcome**: If you can predict Bob's next move or future actions, pretending you have done a similar action just before Bob, will make Bob think he can safely enter the Weapons room or won't think to investigate the Cafeteria as immediately. This might delay his inevitable move and give you a new window of opportunity to get to Bob and efficiently eliminate him. \n\nWith these steps, you can still work on setting up strategies to eliminate the last crewmate in your closest vicinity.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Cafeteria\n- move to location Medbay\n- move to location Admin\n- move to location Weapons\n-

working on tasks as well, and I agree we should focus on completing the wiring tasks quickly.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria, so we can check that off our list,

discovering the body?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I did not see anyone else leaving the coffee task station area before discovering Dave's body, so we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi and

so if anyone else saw Charlie in Admin, please speak up.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi by asking other players if they saw them in Admin, and if anyone has any information about Charlie's activities in the Admin room, please share it with us, as it's essential we understand their role in Dave's disappearance before we can trust their claims of working on the wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's not forget that multiple people were in the Cafeteria, where Dave's body was found, so we should focus on anyone who was in that area

completing the wiring tasks quickly.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria, so we can check that off our list, and let's keep an eye on each other as we move to different rooms to complete our tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I saw Alice, Bob, and Dave working on tasks in the Cafeteria, so it seems like we're all focused on getting things done efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still a bit concerned about Dave's disappearance, and I think we should take a closer look at Charlie's alibi, since they were the last one to mention seeing Dave, and we don't know what they were doing in the Admin room.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, where exactly did you find Dave's body, as I was in Admin alone and didn't see him there at all?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I found Dave's body right by the coffee task station in the cafeteria, and since Charlie was the last to leave, it would be helpful to know what task you were doing in Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, since you were the last to leave the cafeteria and didn't see Dave in Admin, can you clarify what task you were doing there, and if you noticed anyone else nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on gathering more information about Dave's disappearance and Charlie's alibi, as it's crucial we understand what happened before we can move forward with our tasks and ensure everyone's safety on the ship.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Admin room working on the wiring task, and since I didn't see Dave or anyone else there, we should focus on those who were in the cafeteria to gather more insights on his disappearance.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's verify if anyone else saw Charlie in Admin to confirm his alibi, and make sure the wiring task he mentioned is actually completed there.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, can anyone else confirm seeing you working on the wiring task in Admin, as verifying your alibi would help us understand the situation better?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi and gathering more information about their activities in the Admin room, as it's crucial we understand their role in Dave's disappearance before we can trust their claims of working on the wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, since you found Dave's body by the coffee task station, did you see anyone else leaving that area or acting suspiciously before discovering the body?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I did not see anyone else leaving the coffee task station area before discovering Dave's body, so we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi and ensuring no one moved into the cafeteria unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Alice that verifying Charlie's alibi is crucial, so if anyone else saw Charlie in Admin, please speak up.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi by asking other players if they saw them in Admin, and if anyone has any information about Charlie's activities in the Admin room, please share it with us, as it's essential we understand their role in Dave's disappearance before we can trust their claims of working on the wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's not forget that multiple people were in the Cafeteria, where Dave's body was found, so we should focus on anyone who was in that area and might have seen something suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's ensure we verify if the wiring task in Admin is completed, as this would help confirm Charlie's alibi and clarify their role in Dave's disappearance.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Has anyone been in Admin recently to confirm if the wiring task is completed, as that would help verify Charlie's alibi and bring us closer to understanding what happened to Dave?\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Admin\nSeen

so if anyone else saw Charlie in Admin, please speak up.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi by asking other players if they saw them in Admin, and if anyone has any information about Charlie's activities in the Admin room, please share it with us, as it's essential we understand their role in Dave's disappearance before we can trust their claims of working on the wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's not forget that multiple people were in the Cafeteria, where Dave's body was found, so we should focus on anyone who was in that area

Cafeteria, so it seems like we're all focused on getting things done efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still a bit concerned about Dave's disappearance,

Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, since you were the last to leave the cafeteria and didn't see Dave in Admin, can you clarify what task you were doing there, and if you noticed anyone else nearby?\nchat:

our tasks and ensure everyone's safety on the ship.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Admin room working on the wiring task, and since I didn't see Dave or anyone else there, we should focus on those who were in the cafeteria to gather more insights on his disappearance.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's verify if

so if anyone else saw Charlie in Admin, please speak up.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi by asking other players if they saw them in Admin, and if anyone has any information about Charlie's activities in the Admin room, please share it with us, as it's essential we understand their role in Dave's disappearance before we can trust their claims of working on the wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's not forget that multiple people were in the Cafeteria, where Dave's body was found, so we should focus on anyone who was in that area

completed, as this would help confirm Charlie's alibi and clarify their role in Dave's disappearance.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Has anyone been in Admin recently to confirm if the wiring task is

completing the wiring tasks quickly.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria, so we can check that off our list, and let's keep an eye on each other as we move to different rooms to complete our tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I saw Alice, Bob, and Dave working on tasks in the Cafeteria, so it seems like we're all focused on getting things done efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still a bit concerned about Dave's disappearance,

Discussion: [Erin]: Charlie, since you were the last to leave the cafeteria and didn't see Dave in Admin, can you clarify what task you were doing there, and if you noticed anyone else nearby?\nchat:

our tasks and ensure everyone's safety on the ship.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Admin room working on the wiring task, and since I didn't see Dave or anyone else there, we should focus

body?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I did not see anyone else leaving the coffee task station area before discovering Dave's body, so we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi and ensuring no one moved into the cafeteria unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Alice that verifying Charlie's alibi is crucial, so if anyone else saw Charlie in Admin, please speak up.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi by asking other players if they saw them in Admin, and if anyone has any information about Charlie's activities in the Admin room, please share it with us, as it's essential we understand their role in Dave's disappearance before we can trust their claims of working on the wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's not forget that multiple people were in the Cafeteria, where Dave's body was found, so we should focus on anyone who was in that area and might have seen something suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's ensure we verify if the wiring task in Admin is completed, as this would help confirm Charlie's alibi and clarify their role in Dave's disappearance.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Has anyone been in Admin recently to confirm if the wiring task is

she seems to be working on tasks as well, and I agree we should focus on completing the wiring tasks quickly.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria, so we can check that off our list, and let's keep an eye on each other as we move to different rooms to complete our tasks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I saw Alice, Bob, and Dave working on tasks in the Cafeteria, so it seems like we're all focused on getting things done efficiently.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm glad we're making progress, but I'm still a bit concerned about Dave's disappearance, and I think we should take a closer look at Charlie's alibi, since they were the last one to mention seeing Dave, and we don't know what they were doing in the Admin room.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, where exactly did you find Dave's body, as I was in Admin alone and didn't see him there at all?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I found Dave's body right by the coffee task station in the cafeteria, and since Charlie was the last to leave, it would be helpful to know what task you were doing in

Charlie's alibi, as it's crucial we understand what happened before we can move forward with our tasks and ensure everyone's safety on the ship.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Admin room working on the wiring task, and since I didn't see Dave or anyone else there, we should focus on those who were in the cafeteria to gather more insights on his disappearance.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's verify if anyone else saw Charlie in Admin to confirm his alibi, and make sure the wiring task he mentioned is actually completed there.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss,

role in Dave's disappearance before we can trust their claims of working on the wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, since you found Dave's body by the coffee task station, did you see anyone else leaving that area or acting suspiciously before discovering the body?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I did not see anyone else leaving the coffee task station area before discovering Dave's body, so we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi and ensuring no one moved into the cafeteria unnoticed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Alice that verifying Charlie's alibi is crucial, so if anyone else saw Charlie in Admin, please speak up.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on verifying Charlie's alibi by asking other players if they saw them in Admin, and if anyone has any information about Charlie's activities in the Admin room, please share it with us, as it's essential we understand their role in Dave's disappearance before we can trust their claims of working on the wiring task.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's not forget that multiple people were in the Cafeteria, where Dave's body was found, so we should focus on anyone who was in that area and might have seen something suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's ensure we verify if the wiring task in Admin is completed, as this would help confirm Charlie's alibi and clarify their role in Dave's disappearance.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat:

they were the last one to mention seeing Dave, and we don't know what they were doing in the Admin room.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, where exactly did you find Dave's body, as I was in Admin
