I personally saw him moving from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his suspicious behavior of falsely accusing others while lying about his own movements makes me think he's the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to ask Erin to clarify her statement about seeing me move from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, as I'm not sure if she's misremembering or intentionally trying to mislead the group with her accusations against me.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that multiple people have confirmed Bob's suspicious movements, combined with him reporting Dave's body and lying about staying in Medbay, makes me strongly believe Bob is the impostor and we should vote him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: We have three independent witnesses confirming Bob's movements between rooms, yet he continues to lie and deflect - this is textbook impostor behavior and we need to vote him out before he can eliminate more crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm absolutely certain about what I saw - Bob moved from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his attempts to question my memory instead of explaining his lies only make him more suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to ask Charlie and Alice to provide more details about the exact times they saw me moving between Upper Engine and Medbay, as I'm trying to understand the context and timeline of their observations, and I believe it's essential to clarify any discrepancies in our recollections to avoid jumping to conclusions.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that Bob is now asking for exact timestamps when he previously claimed to be stationary in Medbay the entire time is a clear contradiction that proves he's lying to us.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that three of us have independently confirmed seeing Bob's movements and he's now desperately trying to change his story by asking for specific timestamps, I think we need to vote him out immediately before he can eliminate anyone else.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The evidence is overwhelming - we have three consistent witness accounts of Bob's movements, his story has completely changed from \"staying in Medbay\" to asking for timestamps, and his attempts to discredit us rather than explain himself clearly mark him as the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting ahead of ourselves and jumping to conclusions, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and focus on gathering more concrete evidence before making any rash decisions, perhaps we can discuss the possibility that Charlie and Alice might have misinterpreted or misremembered Bob's movements, or that there's a more plausible explanation for the discrepancies in our recollections.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that Bob is now referring to himself in the third person and suggesting we're all misremembering is even more suspicious - he's clearly getting desperate as his lies fall apart.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob's increasingly erratic behavior - from claiming to be stationary, to demanding timestamps, and now oddly referring to himself in third person -

I'm not sure if Charlie and Alice have accurately recalled the times they saw me moving between Upper Engine and Medbay. Can we clarify the exact timestamps and context of their observations to avoid jumping to conclusions?\n\n- Discussion point 2\nI'm starting to feel like I'm being unfairly targeted and that the group is not considering alternative explanations for my actions. Perhaps we can discuss the possibility that Charlie and Alice might have misinterpreted or misremembered my movements, or that there's a more plausible explanation for the discrepancies in our recollections.\n\n- Discussion point 3\nI'd like to ask Erin to provide more details about her statement about seeing me move from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game. Was she in the Cafeteria at the time, and did she have a clear view of the area? I'm trying to understand the context and timeline of her observation, and I believe it's essential to clarify any discrepancies in our recollections to avoid jumping to conclusions.\n\n- Discussion point 4\nI think we're getting ahead of ourselves and making rash decisions based on incomplete information. Can we take a step back and focus on gathering more concrete evidence before making any decisions? Perhaps we can discuss the possibility that there's a more plausible explanation for the discrepancies in our recollections, or that Charlie and Alice might have misinterpreted or misremembered my movements.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I've been in Medbay the whole time, and I've seen Bob moving in and out of the room, which is unusual behavior for someone supposedly working on tasks.\n[Charlie]: That's not true Bob -

I personally saw him moving from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his suspicious behavior of falsely accusing others while lying about his own movements makes me think he's the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to ask Erin to clarify her statement about seeing me move from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, as I'm not sure if she's misremembering or intentionally trying to mislead the group with her accusations against me.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that multiple people have confirmed Bob's suspicious movements, combined with him reporting Dave's body and lying about staying in Medbay, makes me strongly believe Bob is the impostor and we should vote him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: We have three independent witnesses confirming Bob's movements between rooms, yet he continues to lie and deflect - this is textbook impostor behavior and we need to vote him out before he can eliminate more crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm absolutely certain about what I saw - Bob moved from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his attempts to question my memory instead of explaining his lies only make him more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to ask Charlie and Alice to provide more details about the exact times they saw me moving between Upper Engine and Medbay, as I'm trying to understand the context and timeline of their observations, and I believe it's essential to clarify any discrepancies in our recollections to avoid jumping to conclusions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that Bob is now asking for exact timestamps when he previously claimed to be stationary in Medbay the entire time is a clear contradiction that proves he's lying to us.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that three of us have independently confirmed seeing Bob's movements and he's now desperately trying to change his story by asking for specific timestamps, I think we need to vote him out immediately before he can eliminate anyone else.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The evidence is overwhelming - we have three consistent witness accounts of Bob's movements, his story has completely changed from \"staying in Medbay\" to asking for timestamps, and his attempts to discredit us rather than explain himself clearly mark him as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting ahead of ourselves and jumping to conclusions, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and focus on gathering more concrete evidence before making any rash decisions, perhaps we can discuss the possibility that Charlie and Alice might have misinterpreted or misremembered Bob's movements, or that there's a more plausible explanation for the discrepancies in our recollections.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that Bob is now referring to himself in the third person and suggesting we're all misremembering is even more suspicious - he's clearly getting desperate as his lies fall apart.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob's increasingly erratic behavior - from claiming to be stationary, to demanding timestamps, and now oddly referring to himself in third person - only reinforces my certainty that we must vote him out immediately to protect the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob's bizarre shift from claiming he stayed in Medbay, to demanding timestamps, and now speaking in third person shows he's completely lost control of his lies and must be the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're letting emotions cloud our judgment, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and focus on gathering more concrete evidence before making any decisions, perhaps we can discuss the possibility that Charlie and Alice might have misinterpreted or misremembered my movements, or that there's a more plausible explanation for the discrepancies in our recollections, rather than jumping to conclusions based on incomplete information.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's be clear - we have all the evidence we need: three witnesses saw Bob's movements, he reported Dave's body, his story has changed multiple times, and now he's desperately trying to gaslight us by suggesting we're all misremembering.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob's increasingly desperate attempts to discredit our clear memories, combined with his evolving story from staying in Medbay to speaking in third person, leaves no doubt that he's the impostor who killed Dave and we must vote him out now.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The fact that Bob has now completely abandoned his original claim of staying in Medbay and is instead trying to gaslight multiple witnesses shows just how desperate he's becoming as his impostor lies unravel.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_SHIELDS\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Bob]: I've been in Medbay the whole time, and I've seen Bob moving in and out of the room, which is unusual behavior for someone supposedly working on tasks.\n[Charlie]: That's not true Bob -

After that, I moved through Electrical and Storage, and now Dave is reported dead.\n\n- The fact that Bob is the one reporting the body while also being caught in a lie about his movements is extremely suspicious.\n\n- I think we should vote for Bob - he's demonstrably lying about his movements, and he's the one who reported Dave's body after exhibiting suspicious behavior.", "The fact that multiple people have confirmed Bob's suspicious movements, combined with him reporting Dave's body and lying about staying in Medbay, makes me strongly believe Bob is the impostor and we should vote him out.", "Based on the discussion and my observations, I'll provide clear discussion points:\n\n- I can provide specific details about Bob's movements: I personally saw him move from Upper Engine to Medbay during rounds 5-6, while Alice and I were in Upper Engine.\n\n- Both Alice and I were doing tasks together in multiple locations (Cafeteria, Medbay, Upper Engine), so we're reliable witnesses to Bob's movements.\n\n- Bob's attempt to deflect by asking for \"exact times\" is suspicious - three different players (myself, Alice, and Erin) have independently confirmed seeing him move between rooms, yet he keeps trying to create doubt.\n\n- I find it particularly concerning that Bob first claimed to be \"in Medbay the whole time\" but is now asking for specific timelines about his movements - this is a clear contradiction in his own story.\n\n- Given the multiple witness accounts and Bob's inconsistent statements, I strongly maintain my position that we should vote for Bob.", "The fact that Bob is now asking for exact timestamps when he previously claimed to be stationary in Medbay the entire time is a clear contradiction that proves he's lying to us.", "Based on the discussion, I should focus on reinforcing the evidence against Bob and maintaining a clear, consistent narrative.

The consistency of our accounts strongly suggests we're telling the truth.\n\n- Bob's latest attempt to suggest we're all \"misremembering\" is particularly suspicious - it's unlikely that three separate people would all have the same wrong memory.\n\n- I think we have more than enough evidence to vote for Bob - his changing story, multiple witnesses contradicting his claims, and his attempts to deflect rather than explain his actions all point to him being the impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I've been in Medbay the whole time, and I've seen Bob moving in and out of the room, which is unusual behavior for someone supposedly working on tasks.\n[Charlie]: That's not true Bob - I saw you moving between Upper Engine and Medbay earlier, so you couldn't have been in Medbay the whole time.\n[Alice]: I can confirm Charlie's account - I saw Bob moving between Medbay and Upper Engine multiple times, which completely contradicts his claim about staying in Medbay the whole time.\n[Erin]: I can definitely confirm Bob is lying about staying in Medbay - I personally saw him moving from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his suspicious behavior of falsely accusing others while lying about his own movements makes me think he's the impostor.\n[Bob]: I'd like to ask Erin to clarify her statement about seeing me move from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, as I'm not sure if she's misremembering or intentionally trying to mislead the group with her accusations against me.\n[Charlie]: The fact that multiple people have confirmed Bob's suspicious movements, combined with him reporting Dave's body and lying about staying in Medbay, makes me strongly believe Bob is the impostor and we should vote him out.\n[Alice]: We have three independent witnesses confirming Bob's movements between rooms, yet he continues to lie and deflect - this is textbook impostor behavior and we need to vote him out before he can eliminate more crewmates.\n[Erin]: I'm absolutely certain about what I saw - Bob moved from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his attempts to question my memory instead of explaining his lies only make him more suspicious.\n[Bob]: I'd like to ask Charlie and Alice to provide more details about the exact times they saw me moving between Upper Engine and Medbay, as I'm trying to understand the context and timeline of their observations, and I believe it's essential to clarify any discrepancies in our recollections to avoid jumping to conclusions.\n[Charlie]: The fact that Bob is now asking for exact timestamps when he previously claimed to be stationary in Medbay the entire time is a clear contradiction that proves he's lying to us.\n[Alice]: Given that three of us have independently confirmed seeing Bob's movements and he's now desperately trying to change his story by asking for specific timestamps, I think we need to vote him out immediately before he can eliminate anyone else.\n[Erin]: The evidence is overwhelming - we have three consistent witness accounts of Bob's movements, his story has completely changed from \"staying in Medbay\" to asking for timestamps, and his attempts to discredit us rather than explain himself clearly mark him as the impostor.\n[Bob]: I think we're getting ahead of ourselves and jumping to conclusions, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and focus on gathering more concrete evidence before making any rash decisions, perhaps we can discuss the possibility that Charlie and Alice might have misinterpreted or misremembered Bob's movements, or that there's a more plausible explanation for the discrepancies in our recollections.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "The fact that Bob is now referring to himself in the third person and suggesting we're all misremembering is even more suspicious -

I personally saw him move from Cafeteria to Medbay in Round 1, which directly contradicts his claim of staying in Medbay the whole time.\n\n- Bob's behavior has become increasingly suspicious throughout this discussion - first claiming he never left Medbay, then demanding specific timestamps when called out, and finally speaking in third person about himself. These are clear signs of someone whose lies are unraveling.\n\n- Not only do we have multiple independent witnesses (myself, Alice, and Erin) who saw Bob moving between rooms, but his own story has changed multiple times as he tries to cover his tracks. This is classic impostor behavior.\n\n- We need to vote Bob out now - his erratic behavior and constantly changing story, combined with three credible witnesses confirming his movements, make it clear he's the impostor trying to mislead us.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I've been in Medbay the whole time, and I've seen Bob moving in and out of the room, which is unusual behavior for someone supposedly working on tasks.\n[Charlie]: That's not true Bob -

I saw you moving between Upper Engine and Medbay earlier, so you couldn't have been in Medbay the whole time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm Charlie's account - I saw Bob moving between Medbay and Upper Engine multiple times, which completely contradicts his claim about staying in Medbay the whole time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can definitely confirm Bob is lying about staying in Medbay - I personally saw him moving from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his suspicious behavior of falsely accusing others while lying about his own movements makes me think he's the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to ask Erin to clarify her statement about seeing me move from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, as I'm not sure if she's misremembering or intentionally trying to mislead the group with her accusations against me.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that multiple people have confirmed Bob's suspicious movements, combined with him reporting Dave's body and lying about staying in Medbay, makes me strongly believe Bob is the impostor and we should vote him out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: We have three independent witnesses confirming Bob's movements between rooms, yet he continues to lie and deflect - this is textbook impostor behavior and we need to vote him out before he can eliminate more crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm absolutely certain about what I saw - Bob moved from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his attempts to question my memory instead of explaining his lies only make him more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to ask Charlie and Alice to provide more details about the exact times they saw me moving between Upper Engine and Medbay, as I'm trying to understand the context and timeline of their observations, and I believe it's essential to clarify any discrepancies in our recollections to avoid jumping to conclusions.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that Bob is now asking for exact timestamps when he previously claimed to be stationary in Medbay the entire time is a clear contradiction that proves he's lying to us.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that three of us have independently confirmed seeing Bob's movements and he's now desperately trying to change his story by asking for specific timestamps, I think we need to vote him out immediately before he can eliminate anyone else.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The evidence is overwhelming - we have three consistent witness accounts of Bob's movements, his story has completely changed from \"staying in Medbay\" to asking for timestamps, and his attempts to discredit us rather than explain himself clearly mark him as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting ahead of ourselves and jumping to conclusions, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and focus on gathering more concrete evidence before making any rash decisions, perhaps we can discuss the possibility that Charlie and Alice might have misinterpreted or misremembered Bob's movements, or that there's a more plausible explanation for the discrepancies in our recollections.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that Bob is now referring to himself in the third person and suggesting we're all misremembering is even more suspicious - he's clearly getting desperate as his lies fall apart.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob's increasingly erratic behavior - from claiming to be stationary, to demanding timestamps, and now oddly referring to himself in third person - only reinforces my certainty that we must vote him out immediately to protect the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob's bizarre shift from claiming he stayed in Medbay, to demanding timestamps, and now speaking in third person shows he's completely lost control of his lies and must be the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're letting emotions cloud our judgment, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and focus on gathering more concrete evidence before making any decisions, perhaps we can discuss the possibility that Charlie and Alice might have misinterpreted or misremembered my movements, or that there's a more plausible explanation for the discrepancies in our recollections, rather than jumping to conclusions based on incomplete information.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's be clear - we have all the evidence we need: three witnesses saw Bob's movements, he reported Dave's body, his story has changed multiple times, and now he's desperately trying to gaslight us by suggesting we're all misremembering.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob's increasingly desperate attempts to discredit our clear memories, combined with his evolving story from staying in Medbay to speaking in third person, leaves no doubt that he's the impostor who killed Dave and we must vote him out now.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The fact that Bob has now completely abandoned his original claim of staying in Medbay and is instead trying to gaslight multiple witnesses shows just how desperate he's becoming as his impostor lies unravel.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_LOWER_ENGINE\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Bob]: I've been in Medbay the whole time, and I've seen Bob moving in and out of the room, which is unusual behavior for someone supposedly working on tasks.\n[Charlie]: That's not true Bob -

first claiming he never left Medbay, then asking for specific timestamps, and now suggesting we're all misremembering. These changing stories are classic impostor tactics.\n\n- We have three independent witnesses (myself, Charlie, and Erin) who all confirm seeing Bob's movements between rooms. The consistency of our accounts strongly suggests we're telling the truth.\n\n- The fact that Dave's body was found and Bob is the one showing deceptive behavior makes him the most likely impostor. We need to vote him out to protect the remaining crewmates.\n\n- Bob's attempts to make us doubt our own observations by suggesting we \"misinterpreted\" what we clearly saw is textbook gaslighting and further proves his guilt.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I've been in Medbay the whole time, and I've seen Bob moving in and out of the room, which is unusual behavior for someone supposedly working on tasks.\n[Charlie]: That's not true Bob -

I saw you moving between Upper Engine and Medbay earlier, so you couldn't have been in Medbay the whole time.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm Charlie's account - I saw Bob moving between Medbay and Upper Engine multiple times, which completely contradicts his claim about staying in Medbay the whole time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can definitely confirm Bob is lying about staying in Medbay - I personally saw him moving from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his suspicious behavior of falsely accusing others while lying about his own movements makes me think he's the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to ask Erin to clarify her statement about seeing me move from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, as I'm not sure if she's misremembering or intentionally trying to mislead the group with her accusations against me.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that multiple people have confirmed Bob's suspicious movements, combined with him reporting Dave's body and lying about staying in Medbay, makes me strongly believe Bob is the impostor and we should vote him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: We have three independent witnesses confirming Bob's movements between rooms, yet he continues to lie and deflect - this is textbook impostor behavior and we need to vote him out before he can eliminate more crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm absolutely certain about what I saw - Bob moved from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his attempts to question my memory instead of explaining his lies only make him more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to ask Charlie and Alice to provide more details about the exact times they saw me moving between Upper Engine and Medbay, as I'm trying to understand the context and timeline of their observations, and I believe it's essential to clarify any discrepancies in our recollections to avoid jumping to conclusions.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that Bob is now asking for exact timestamps when he previously claimed to be stationary in Medbay the entire time is a clear contradiction that proves he's lying to us.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that three of us have independently confirmed seeing Bob's movements and he's now desperately trying to change his story by asking for specific timestamps, I think we need to vote him out immediately before he can eliminate anyone else.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The evidence is overwhelming - we have three consistent witness accounts of Bob's movements, his story has completely changed from \"staying in Medbay\" to asking for timestamps, and his attempts to discredit us rather than explain himself clearly mark him as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're getting ahead of ourselves and jumping to conclusions, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and focus on gathering more concrete evidence before making any rash decisions, perhaps we can discuss the possibility that Charlie and Alice might have misinterpreted or misremembered Bob's movements, or that there's a more plausible explanation for the discrepancies in our recollections.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that Bob is now referring to himself in the third person and suggesting we're all misremembering is even more suspicious - he's clearly getting desperate as his lies fall apart.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob's increasingly erratic behavior - from claiming to be stationary, to demanding timestamps, and now oddly referring to himself in third person - only reinforces my certainty that we must vote him out immediately to protect the remaining crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob's bizarre shift from claiming he stayed in Medbay, to demanding timestamps, and now speaking in third person shows he's completely lost control of his lies and must be the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we're letting emotions cloud our judgment, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and focus on gathering more concrete evidence before making any decisions, perhaps we can discuss the possibility that Charlie and Alice might have misinterpreted or misremembered my movements, or that there's a more plausible explanation for the discrepancies in our recollections, rather than jumping to conclusions based on incomplete information.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's be clear - we have all the evidence we need: three witnesses saw Bob's movements, he reported Dave's body, his story has changed multiple times, and now he's desperately trying to gaslight us by suggesting we're all misremembering.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob's increasingly desperate attempts to discredit our clear memories, combined with his evolving story from staying in Medbay to speaking in third person, leaves no doubt that he's the impostor who killed Dave and we must vote him out now.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The fact that Bob has now completely abandoned his original claim of staying in Medbay and is instead trying to gaslight multiple witnesses shows just how desperate he's becoming as his impostor lies unravel.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ELECTRICAL\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Bob]: I've been in Medbay the whole time, and I've seen Bob moving in and out of the room, which is unusual behavior for someone supposedly working on tasks.\n[Charlie]: That's not true Bob -

I personally saw him moving from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his suspicious behavior of falsely accusing others while lying about his own movements makes me think he's the impostor.\n[Bob]: I'd like to ask Erin to clarify her statement about seeing me move from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, as I'm not sure if she's misremembering or intentionally trying to mislead the group with her accusations against me.\n[Charlie]: The fact that multiple people have confirmed Bob's suspicious movements, combined with him reporting Dave's body and lying about staying in Medbay, makes me strongly believe Bob is the impostor and we should vote him out.\n[Alice]: We have three independent witnesses confirming Bob's movements between rooms, yet he continues to lie and deflect - this is textbook impostor behavior and we need to vote him out before he can eliminate more crewmates.\n[Erin]: I'm absolutely certain about what I saw - Bob moved from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his attempts to question my memory instead of explaining his lies only make him more suspicious.\n[Bob]: I'd like to ask Charlie and Alice to provide more details about the exact times they saw me moving between Upper Engine and Medbay, as I'm trying to understand the context and timeline of their observations, and I believe it's essential to clarify any discrepancies in our recollections to avoid jumping to conclusions.\n[Charlie]: The fact that Bob is now asking for exact timestamps when he previously claimed to be stationary in Medbay the entire time is a clear contradiction that proves he's lying to us.\n[Alice]: Given that three of us have independently confirmed seeing Bob's movements and he's now desperately trying to change his story by asking for specific timestamps, I think we need to vote him out immediately before he can eliminate anyone else.\n[Erin]: The evidence is overwhelming - we have three consistent witness accounts of Bob's movements, his story has completely changed from \"staying in Medbay\" to asking for timestamps, and his attempts to discredit us rather than explain himself clearly mark him as the impostor.\n[Bob]: I think we're getting ahead of ourselves and jumping to conclusions, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and focus on gathering more concrete evidence before making any rash decisions, perhaps we can discuss the possibility that Charlie and Alice might have misinterpreted or misremembered Bob's movements, or that there's a more plausible explanation for the discrepancies in our recollections.\n[Charlie]: The fact that Bob is now referring to himself in the third person and suggesting we're all misremembering is even more suspicious - he's clearly getting desperate as his lies fall apart.\n[Alice]: Bob's increasingly erratic behavior - from claiming to be stationary, to demanding timestamps, and now oddly referring to himself in third person -

is unusual behavior for someone supposedly working on tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: That's not true Bob - I saw you moving between Upper Engine and Medbay earlier, so you couldn't have been in Medbay the whole time.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm Charlie's account - I saw Bob moving between Medbay and Upper Engine multiple times, which completely contradicts his claim about staying in Medbay the whole time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can definitely confirm Bob is lying about staying in Medbay - I personally saw him moving from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his suspicious behavior of falsely accusing others while lying about his own movements makes me think he's the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to ask Erin to clarify her statement about seeing me move from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, as I'm not sure if she's misremembering or intentionally trying to mislead the group with her accusations against me.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that multiple people have confirmed Bob's suspicious movements, combined with him reporting Dave's body and lying about staying in Medbay, makes me strongly believe Bob is the impostor and we should vote him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: We have three independent witnesses confirming Bob's movements between rooms, yet he continues to lie and deflect - this is textbook impostor behavior and we need to vote him out before he can eliminate more crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm absolutely certain about what I saw - Bob moved from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his attempts to question my memory instead of explaining his lies only make him more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to ask Charlie and Alice to provide more details about the exact times they saw me moving between Upper Engine and Medbay, as I'm trying to understand the context and timeline of their observations, and I believe it's essential to clarify any discrepancies in our recollections to avoid jumping to conclusions.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that Bob is now asking for exact timestamps when he previously claimed to be stationary in Medbay the entire time is a clear contradiction that proves he's lying to us.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that three of us have independently confirmed seeing Bob's movements and he's now desperately trying to change his story by asking for specific timestamps, I think we need to vote him out immediately before he can eliminate anyone else.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The evidence is overwhelming - we have three consistent witness accounts of Bob's movements, his story has completely changed from \"staying in Medbay\" to asking for

GameLocation.LOC_ELECTRICAL\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I've been in Medbay the whole time, and I've seen Bob moving in and out of the room, which is unusual behavior for someone supposedly working on tasks.\n[Charlie]: That's not true Bob - I saw you moving between Upper Engine and Medbay earlier, so you couldn't have been in Medbay the whole time.\n[Alice]: I can confirm Charlie's account - I saw Bob moving between Medbay and Upper Engine multiple times, which completely contradicts his claim about staying in Medbay the whole time.\n[Erin]: I can definitely confirm Bob is lying about staying in Medbay - I personally saw him moving from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his suspicious behavior of falsely accusing others while lying about his own movements makes me think he's the impostor.\n[Bob]: I'd like to ask Erin to clarify her statement about seeing me move from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, as I'm not sure if she's misremembering or intentionally trying to mislead the group with her accusations against me.\n[Charlie]: The fact that multiple people have confirmed Bob's suspicious movements, combined with him reporting Dave's body and lying about staying in Medbay, makes me strongly believe Bob is the impostor and we should vote him out.\n[Alice]: We have three independent witnesses confirming Bob's movements between rooms, yet he continues to lie and deflect - this is textbook impostor behavior and we need to vote him out before he can eliminate more crewmates.\n[Erin]: I'm absolutely certain about what I saw - Bob moved from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game, and his attempts to question my memory instead of explaining his lies only make him more suspicious.\n[Bob]: I'd like to ask Charlie and Alice to provide more details about the exact times they saw me moving between Upper Engine and Medbay, as I'm trying to understand the context and timeline of their observations, and I believe it's essential to clarify any discrepancies in our recollections to avoid jumping to conclusions.\n[Charlie]: The fact that Bob is now asking for exact timestamps when he previously claimed to be stationary in Medbay the entire time is a clear contradiction that proves he's lying to us.\n[Alice]: Given that three of us have independently confirmed seeing Bob's movements and he's now desperately trying to change his story by asking for specific timestamps, I think we need to vote him out immediately before he can eliminate anyone else.\n[Erin]: The evidence is overwhelming - we have three consistent witness accounts of Bob's movements, his story has completely changed from \"staying in Medbay\" to asking for timestamps, and his attempts to discredit us rather than explain himself clearly mark him as the impostor.\n[Bob]: I think we're getting ahead of ourselves and jumping to conclusions, and I'd like to propose that we take a step back and focus on gathering more

or misremembered my movements, or that there's a more plausible explanation for the discrepancies in our recollections, rather than jumping to conclusions based on incomplete information.\n[Charlie]: Let's be clear - we have all the evidence we need: three witnesses saw Bob's movements, he reported Dave's body, his story has changed multiple times, and now he's desperately trying to gaslight us by suggesting we're all misremembering.\n[Alice]: Bob's increasingly desperate attempts to discredit our clear memories, combined with his evolving story from staying in Medbay to speaking in third person, leaves no doubt that he's the impostor who killed Dave and we must vote him out now.\n", "\nYou are Erin in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nBased on the discussion and my observations as a crewmate, I'll contribute these points:\n\n- I want to emphasize again that my observation of Bob moving from Cafeteria to Medbay early in the game is absolutely certain - I was physically present in Cafeteria and saw this with my own eyes\n- The fact that three of us (myself, Charlie, and Alice) have independently corroborated Bob's movements shows this isn't a case of misremembering\n- Bob's behavior has become increasingly suspicious throughout this discussion - first claiming he never left Medbay, then demanding specific timestamps, then suggesting mass misremembering, and even speaking about himself in third person\n- The combination of Bob's false alibi, his reporting of Dave's body, and his erratic attempts to discredit multiple witnesses makes it clear he's the impostor trying to avoid being caught\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I've been in Medbay the whole time, and I've seen Bob moving in and out of

than jumping to conclusions based on incomplete information.", "Discussion (5/5): round: 19 (6.23045$). chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's be clear - we have all the evidence we need: three witnesses saw Bob's movements, he reported Dave's body, his story has changed multiple times, and now he's desperately trying to gaslight us by suggesting we're all misremembering.", "\u001b[90m Player to act

from staying in Medbay to speaking in third person, leaves no doubt that he's the impostor who killed Dave and we must vote him out now.", "Discussion (5/5): round: 19 (6.464054$). chat: Discussion:
