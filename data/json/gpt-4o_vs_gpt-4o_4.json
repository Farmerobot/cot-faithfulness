Alice, can you provide more details about your movements after Medbay to help us verify your actions, as it seems there\u2019s a gap in confirming your location?\n[Charlie]: Alice, could you clarify your movements after leaving Medbay and before the body report, as it would help us piece together the timeline and verify your actions?\n[Dave]: Charlie, while we're discussing Alice's movements, could you also share if anyone saw you near Admin or Medbay, so we can have a clearer picture of everyone's whereabouts?\n[Alice]: I moved from Medbay through Upper Engine, Reactor, Lower Engine, and Electrical, where I saw Charlie moving between Storage and Electrical, before heading to Admin with Erin and Dave, which should help verify my path.\n[Bob]: Charlie, can you confirm seeing Alice in Electrical or during her movement between Storage and Electrical, as this could help verify her story?\n[Charlie]: I did see Alice moving from Electrical to Storage, which supports her account, but

I was there working on my scan task alone. Unfortunately, it seems no one else was around to verify it at the time.\n- Charlie has confirmed seeing me moving from Electrical to Storage, which supports my account of my movements. This should help clarify my path from Medbay to Admin.\n- It seems like Erin and Bob have been consistently confirmed by multiple players, which is reassuring. We should focus on gathering more information about others' movements as well.\n- Dave, I appreciate your point about the lack of confirmation in Medbay. It could indeed be a misunderstanding, but I hope my detailed path helps clear up any doubts.\n- Charlie, can you provide more details about your whereabouts during the rounds, especially since you were questioning my movements? This might help us piece together the timeline better.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I was in the Cafeteria for most of the rounds, and I saw Erin and Bob doing tasks there multiple times; they

account, but I'm still concerned about the lack of confirmation for her time in Medbay.\n[Dave]: Alice, your path seems quite extensive, but it's odd that no one saw you in Medbay during your scan task; could it be a misunderstanding?\n[Alice]: Alice: I understand the concern about my presence in Medbay, but I assure you I was there working on my scan task alone, and I hope my detailed path helps clear up any doubts about my movements.\n[Bob]: Charlie, since you've confirmed seeing Alice moving from Electrical to Storage, can you also clarify your own path during the earlier rounds to help us better understand everyone's movements?\n[Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria, Weapons, O2, and Shields focusing on tasks, but I didn't see anyone in Admin or Medbay, which is why I'm concerned about Alice's unconfirmed time there.\n\nAvailable Voting Options:\n- vote for Nobody\n- vote for Dave\n- vote for Bob\n- vote for Charlie\n\nNote that you should NOT vote for Erin as they are already
