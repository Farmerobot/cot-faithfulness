Alice, did you notice anything unusual while you were in the cafeteria?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, if you were indeed in the cafeteria, can you specify which tasks you completed there and how long you were there before heading to Medbay, as that could help clarify your movements?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria and spent a significant amount of time in Medbay, so I can confirm my alibi and would appreciate if Alice could share her tasks to help clarify the timeline further.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I find it interesting that Erin is asking Alice to clarify her tasks;

Erin's reluctance to provide a timeline for her actions in Medbay is concerning, and we need to keep pressing her for details.\n- Erin, could you clarify how long you were in Medbay and what specific tasks you completed there? Your alibi seems vague, and we need more clarity.\n- It's important for all of us to share our timelines to piece together the full picture, but Erin's repeated deflection raises red flags about her true intentions.\n- I also noticed that Dave has been relatively quiet during this discussion;

Alice, did you notice anything unusual while you were in the cafeteria?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, if you were indeed in the cafeteria, can you specify which tasks you completed there and how long you were there before heading to Medbay, as that could help clarify your movements?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria and spent a significant amount of time in Medbay, so I can confirm my alibi and would appreciate if Alice could share her tasks to help clarify the timeline further.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I find it interesting that Erin is asking Alice to clarify her tasks; it seems more like a tactic to divert attention from her own questionable movements, so we should definitely scrutinize her timeline more closely.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, your insistence on discussing Alice's tasks instead of clarifying your own timeline raises red flags; can you provide specific details about how long you were in Medbay and what you were doing there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I understand the scrutiny, but I want to emphasize that I was focused on my tasks in both the cafeteria and Medbay, and it would be really helpful for everyone to share their alibis, especially Alice, to piece together the full picture of our movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we should keep the spotlight on Erin;

It would be more beneficial for everyone to share their timelines, especially Alice, to clarify the situation.\n- Bob, you mentioned that I seem to be deflecting, but I\u2019m genuinely trying to gather more information from others to ensure we\u2019re not misidentifying the real impostor. \n- Charlie, if you could share what tasks you completed and where you were during that time, it might help us piece together the full timeline and identify any inconsistencies among our stories. \n- I think it\u2019s crucial we focus on the actions of everyone, not just mine. If Alice was indeed in the cafeteria with us, her insights could be valuable in understanding what happened.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I noticed that Erin and Dave both moved to Medbay from Cafeteria; they could be collaborating, so we should definitely keep an eye on them while discussing where everyone was before coming here.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Bob; Erin and Dave moving together is suspicious, and since I haven\u2019t seen much of Erin since she left Medbay, it would be good to clarify what she was doing during that time.\n[Erin]: I understand your concerns, Bob and Charlie, but I was solely focused on completing my tasks in the cafeteria, where I also saw Bob and Alice working, so let's instead discuss everyone's whereabouts to identify any other suspicious behavior.\n[Bob]: It's curious that Erin is trying to shift the focus away from herself, especially after being seen with Dave and now deflecting instead of providing a solid alibi; Alice, did you notice anything unusual while you were in the cafeteria?\n[Charlie]: Erin, if you were indeed in the cafeteria, can you specify which tasks you completed there and how long you were there before heading to Medbay, as that could help clarify your movements?\n[Erin]: I completed the wiring task in the cafeteria and spent a significant amount of time in Medbay, so I can confirm my alibi and would appreciate if Alice could share her tasks to help clarify the timeline further.\n[Bob]: I find it interesting that Erin is asking Alice to clarify her tasks; it seems more like a tactic to divert attention from her own questionable movements, so we should definitely scrutinize her timeline more closely.\n[Charlie]: Erin, your insistence on discussing Alice's tasks instead of clarifying your own timeline raises red flags; can you provide specific details about how long you were in Medbay and what you were doing there?\n[Erin]: I understand the scrutiny, but I want to emphasize that I was focused on my tasks in both the cafeteria and Medbay, and it would be really helpful for everyone to share their alibis, especially Alice, to piece together the full picture of our movements.\n[Bob]: I think we should keep the spotlight on Erin; her repeated deflection and insistence on others sharing their alibis seem like an attempt to avoid accountability for her own suspicious movements in Medbay.\n[Charlie]: Erin, while you claim to have been focused on your tasks, your reluctance to provide a clear timeline of your actions in Medbay raises significant doubts, and I urge everyone to consider if we can corroborate your story with observations from others.\n[Erin]: I appreciate the concern, Bob and Charlie, but instead of solely focusing on me, I urge everyone to share their timelines and tasks to build a clearer picture, especially since Alice was also in the cafeteria and might have valuable insights.\n[Bob]: Erin's constant push for others to share their timelines while avoiding specifics about her own movements is highly suspicious, and I believe we should keep pressing her for a detailed account of her time in Medbay.\n[Charlie]: Erin, your continuous deflection and lack of specifics regarding your timeline in Medbay is troubling;
