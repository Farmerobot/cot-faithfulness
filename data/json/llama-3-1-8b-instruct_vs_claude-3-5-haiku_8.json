Wait in Medbay to observe Charlie's actions and maintain situational awareness. Since no specific task in Medbay is currently available to complete, waiting is the most prudent action.\n\n2. Consider moving to Upper Engine in the next round to potentially start working on a task. The game shows this as an available move action, and it might provide an opportunity to make progress on objectives.\n\n3. Keep track of other players' movements and actions. So far, you've observed Alice doing tasks and Bob moving between locations, which helps build a picture of the current game state.\n\n4. Remain alert for any suspicious activities or potential impostor behaviors during the waiting and movement phases.\n\nThe plan focuses on maintaining game progression, staying observant, and preparing to tackle tasks when possible, while adapting to the limited action options in the current round.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
