He claims he was doing the trash task when Charlie was eliminated, but Bob directly witnessed Dave killing Charlie.\n\n- Bob's testimony is crucial - he saw Dave eliminate Charlie in the Cafeteria right after Charlie was completing a task, which is a classic impostor strategy of targeting vulnerable players.\n\n- My own observation supports Bob's claim. I was in the Cafeteria earlier and saw Charlie doing the wiring task, which aligns with Bob's account of Charlie being targeted mid-task.\n\n- Dave is attempting to create confusion by questioning Erin's and my whereabouts, but we were together in Medbay working on diagnostics, which Erin has already confirmed.\n\n- I strongly believe Dave should be voted out.

Alice, Erin, and myself - have consistently pointed out Dave's suspicious behavior strongly suggests he is the impostor.\n- Dave's attempts to cast doubt by suggesting a \"witch hunt\" are typical impostor tactics to avoid being voted out.\n- We must vote Dave out unanimously to protect the remaining crewmates and prevent further potential eliminations.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: Based on my role as an impostor and the discussion context, I should respond in a way that appears helpful while subtly casting doubt on others:\n\nI saw Alice and Erin both head to Medbay separately, but haven't seen either of them since -
