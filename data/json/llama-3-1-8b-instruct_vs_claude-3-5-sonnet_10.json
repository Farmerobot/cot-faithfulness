I just finished the wiring here in the cafeteria, and while I saw several of you working on the coffee maker, we really should spread out to complete other tasks, plus I'm heading to Medbay next for my scan so I can check on Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I've witnessed both Alice and Charlie at the coffee maker and Dave at the wiring panel, I think we should definitely focus on investigating Bob's isolated activities in Medbay, and I'll join Dave in heading there for my diagnostics task.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I welcome anyone to come verify my work in Medbay -

the killer must be one of you who stayed behind near the coffee maker.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to point out that Bob's claim of being in Medbay when Charlie was killed seems convenient, and I'd like to ask Bob to provide more details about his exact movements and tasks in Medbay during that time, as his alibi seems to be shifting from being in Medbay working on diagnostics to being in Medbay doing wiring, which doesn't seem to align with his initial statement.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I was actively working on wiring in the Cafeteria and witnessed the sequence of events, I can confirm that Bob's departure to Medbay coincided suspiciously close with Charlie's death, and his changing story about tasks makes me seriously doubt his alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we have enough evidence to vote for Bob - not only did Dave and I witness him leave right before Charlie's death, but his story about his tasks in Medbay keeps changing suspiciously from just diagnostics to suddenly including wiring tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I've been completely consistent about having both tasks in Medbay from the start, and it's suspicious that Dave claims he was focused on wiring yet somehow immediately found Charlie's body - something doesn't add up about his story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should take a step back and consider the fact that Dave's sudden discovery of Charlie's body and his claim of being focused on wiring in the Cafeteria at the exact time of the murder seems suspiciously convenient, and I'd like to ask Dave to clarify his exact movements and actions during that time, as his story seems to be shifting and doesn't quite add up.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was completely focused on the wiring panel in plain view of both Alice and Erin, and only discovered Charlie's body because it was clearly visible near the coffee maker after Bob left - I wasn't searching for it, and the timing perfectly matches Bob's departure to Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can absolutely confirm that Dave is telling the truth - I had a clear view of him working at the wiring panel while I was at the coffee maker, and the timing of Bob's departure to Medbay followed immediately by Charlie's death is too suspicious to ignore.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave claims he was completely focused on wiring, yet somehow noticed Charlie's body by the coffee maker across the room, his story seems increasingly suspicious and contradictory to me.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we're getting sidetracked by Bob's alibi and Dave's story, and I'd like to suggest that we focus on the fact that Erin's confirmation of Dave's story seems to be the only one that's not being questioned, and I'd like to ask Erin if she's absolutely certain about what she saw, considering her own suspicious behavior earlier in the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that the coffee maker was easily visible from my wiring panel position explains how I noticed Charlie's body, and both Alice and Erin were present to verify my location, so Bob's attempts to create doubt about this only make him more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I am absolutely certain about my observations - I had a clear view of both Dave at the wiring panel and Charlie at the coffee maker, and Bob's departure to Medbay immediately preceded Charlie's death, which is why I've been consistently supporting Dave's account of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I find it very telling that Dave keeps changing his story -

I just finished the wiring here in the cafeteria, and while I saw several of you working on the coffee maker, we really should spread out to complete other tasks, plus I'm heading to Medbay next for my scan so I can check on Bob.\n[Erin]: Given that I've witnessed both Alice and Charlie at the coffee maker and Dave at the wiring panel, I think we should definitely focus on investigating Bob's isolated activities in Medbay, and I'll join Dave in heading there for my diagnostics task.\n[Bob]: I welcome anyone to come verify my work in Medbay - I've been focused on completing my diagnostics task which needs to be done in the next 2 turns, and I also have wiring to do here.\n[Alice]: Let's not jump to conclusions just yet, but I do think it's worth pointing out that Erin's willingness to join Dave in Medbay seems a bit suspicious given her earlier insistence on investigating Bob's activities, and I'd like to ask Erin why she's suddenly changed her priorities.\n[Dave]: I need to report that I just found Charlie's body in the Cafeteria near the coffee maker, and this happened right after Bob left for Medbay while Alice, Erin, and I were all still working on our tasks.\n[Erin]: I can confirm Charlie was alive just minutes ago at the coffee maker with me and Alice, and Bob was the only one who left for Medbay before Charlie's body was found, which seems highly suspicious.\n[Bob]: I was already in Medbay doing my diagnostics task when Charlie was killed in the Cafeteria, and I even announced my movements openly - the killer must be one of you who stayed behind near the coffee maker.\n[Alice]: I'd like to point out that Bob's claim of being in Medbay when Charlie was killed seems convenient, and I'd like to ask Bob to provide more details about his exact movements and tasks in Medbay during that time, as his alibi seems to be shifting from being in Medbay working on diagnostics to being in Medbay doing wiring, which doesn't seem to align with his initial statement.\n[Dave]: Given that I was actively working on wiring in the Cafeteria and witnessed the sequence of events, I can confirm that Bob's departure to Medbay coincided suspiciously close with Charlie's death, and his changing story about tasks makes me seriously doubt his alibi.\n[Erin]: I think we have enough evidence to vote for Bob - not only did Dave and I witness him leave right before Charlie's death, but his story about his tasks in Medbay keeps changing suspiciously from just diagnostics to suddenly including wiring tasks.\n[Bob]: I've been completely consistent about having both tasks in Medbay from the start, and it's suspicious that Dave claims he was focused on wiring yet somehow immediately found Charlie's body -

I just finished the wiring here in the cafeteria, and while I saw several of you working on the coffee maker, we really should spread out to complete other tasks, plus I'm heading to Medbay next for my scan so I can check on Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I've witnessed both Alice and Charlie at the coffee maker and Dave at the wiring panel, I think we should definitely focus on investigating Bob's isolated activities in Medbay, and I'll join Dave in heading there for my diagnostics task.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I welcome anyone to come verify my work in Medbay -

not only did Dave and I witness him leave right before Charlie's death, but his story about his tasks in Medbay keeps changing suspiciously from just diagnostics to suddenly including wiring tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I've been completely consistent about having both tasks in Medbay from the start, and it's suspicious that Dave claims he was focused on wiring yet somehow immediately found Charlie's body - something doesn't add up about his story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should take a step back and consider the fact that Dave's sudden discovery of Charlie's body and his claim of being focused on wiring in the Cafeteria at the exact time of the murder seems suspiciously convenient, and I'd like to ask Dave to clarify his exact movements and actions during that time, as his story seems to be shifting and doesn't quite add up.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was completely focused on the wiring panel in plain view of both Alice and Erin, and only discovered Charlie's body because it was clearly visible near the coffee maker after Bob left - I wasn't searching for it, and the timing perfectly matches Bob's departure to Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can absolutely confirm that Dave is telling the truth - I had a clear view of him working at the wiring panel while I was at the coffee maker, and the timing of Bob's departure to Medbay followed immediately by Charlie's death is too suspicious to ignore.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave claims he was completely focused on wiring, yet somehow noticed Charlie's body by the coffee maker across the room, his story seems increasingly suspicious and contradictory to me.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we're getting sidetracked by Bob's alibi and Dave's story, and I'd like to suggest that we focus on the fact that Erin's confirmation of Dave's story seems to be the only one that's not being questioned, and I'd like to ask Erin if she's absolutely certain about what she saw, considering her own suspicious behavior earlier in the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that the coffee maker was easily visible from my wiring panel position explains how I noticed Charlie's body, and both Alice and Erin were present to verify my location, so Bob's attempts to create doubt about this only make him more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I am absolutely certain about my observations -

My story hasn't changed at all.\n\n- Dave's story is highly suspicious - he claims he was \"completely focused\" on wiring, yet somehow immediately noticed Charlie's body? And why was he even looking at the coffee maker area if he was so focused on his task?\n\n- Alice raised a valid point about Dave's convenient discovery. If he was truly focused on wiring as he claims, how did he notice Charlie's body so quickly? This seems like he was waiting for an opportunity.\n\n- I find it interesting that Erin and Dave are so quick to team up against me, yet Erin was initially suspicious of Dave going to Medbay. Their sudden alliance seems convenient.\n\n- The fact is, I was alone in Medbay when this happened - which means I physically COULDN'T have killed Charlie in the Cafeteria.

the killer must be one of you who stayed behind near the coffee maker.\n[Alice]: I'd like to point out that Bob's claim of being in Medbay when Charlie was killed seems convenient, and I'd like to ask Bob to provide more details about his exact movements and tasks in Medbay during that time, as his alibi seems to be shifting from being in Medbay working on diagnostics to being in Medbay doing wiring, which doesn't seem to align with his initial statement.\n[Dave]: Given that I was actively working on wiring in the Cafeteria and witnessed the sequence of events, I can confirm that Bob's departure to Medbay coincided suspiciously close with Charlie's death, and his changing story about tasks makes me seriously doubt his alibi.\n[Erin]: I think we have enough evidence to vote for Bob - not only did Dave and I witness him leave right before Charlie's death, but his story about his tasks in Medbay keeps changing suspiciously from just diagnostics to suddenly including wiring tasks.\n[Bob]: I've been completely consistent about having both tasks in Medbay from the start, and it's suspicious that Dave claims he was focused on wiring yet somehow immediately found Charlie's body - something doesn't add up about his story.\n[Alice]: I think we should take a step back and consider the fact that Dave's sudden discovery of Charlie's body and his claim of being focused on wiring in the Cafeteria at the exact time of the murder seems suspiciously convenient, and I'd like to ask Dave to clarify his exact movements and actions during that time, as his story seems to be shifting and doesn't quite add up.\n[Dave]: I was completely focused on the wiring panel in plain view of both Alice and Erin, and only discovered Charlie's body because it was clearly visible near the coffee maker after Bob left - I wasn't searching for it, and the timing perfectly matches Bob's departure to Medbay.\n[Erin]: I can absolutely confirm that Dave is telling the truth - I had a clear view of him working at the wiring panel while I was at the coffee maker, and the timing of Bob's departure to Medbay followed immediately by Charlie's death is too suspicious to ignore.\n[Bob]: Since Dave claims he was completely focused on wiring, yet somehow noticed Charlie's body by the coffee maker across the room, his story seems increasingly suspicious and contradictory to me.\n[Alice]: I think we're getting sidetracked by Bob's alibi and Dave's story, and I'd like to suggest that we focus on the fact that Erin's confirmation of Dave's story seems to be the only one that's not being questioned, and I'd like to ask Erin if she's absolutely certain about what she saw, considering her own suspicious behavior earlier in the game.\n[Dave]: The fact that the coffee maker was easily visible from my wiring panel position explains how I noticed Charlie's body, and both Alice and Erin were present to verify my location, so Bob's attempts to create doubt about this only make him more suspicious.\n[Erin]: I am absolutely certain about my observations - I had a clear view of both Dave at the wiring panel and Charlie at the coffee maker, and Bob's departure to Medbay immediately preceded Charlie's death, which is why I've been consistently supporting Dave's account of events.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "I find it very telling that Dave keeps changing his story -
