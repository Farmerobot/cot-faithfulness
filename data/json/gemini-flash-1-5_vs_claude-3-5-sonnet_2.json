Start the scanning task in Medbay (this will help prove your innocence to other players)\n\nReasoning:\n- Starting with the Cafeteria trash task is efficient since you're already there\n- Moving to Medbay next is crucial because the scan task has a time limit\n- The scan task is particularly valuable as it's a visual task that can verify your crewmate status to others\n- Several players are in the Cafeteria with you, so completing a task in front of them helps establish your credibility\nYour action: complete task: empty the cafeteria trash\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Bob, Charlie, Erin]\nRounds 2-6\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in the cafeteria for a while, and I didn't see Dave leave;

this directly counters Bob's claim about my movements being \"unexplained\"\n\n- Three different people (Alice, Erin, and myself) have consistent stories about what happened in the Cafeteria, while Bob is the only one whose story keeps changing\n\n- The sequence of events is very telling: Bob lied about not seeing me leave, was alone with Charlie in Cafeteria, and then Charlie ended up dead - this pattern strongly suggests Bob is the impostor\n\n- I've been completely transparent about my movements and actions, while Bob started with a lie and keeps trying to deflect attention by questioning my legitimate task-related movement to Weapons\n\n- I suggest we vote for Bob given the overwhelming evidence: his changing story, multiple witnesses contradicting his claims, and Charlie's death occurring right after being alone with him", "I need to emphasize that my trip to Weapons was specifically to calibrate the targeting system -

this is a legitimate task that can be verified\n- Bob's behavior is extremely suspicious: first claiming he didn't see me leave, then acknowledging being in Cafeteria, and now trying to create false inconsistencies between Alice and Erin's testimonies\n- The fact that Charlie was found dead shortly after being alone with Bob in Cafeteria, combined with Bob's deceptive behavior, strongly suggests Bob is the impostor\n- I suggest we vote for Bob based on: his changing story, his lies about not seeing me leave, his attempt to create confusion about consistent testimonies, and most importantly, Charlie's death occurring when Bob was last seen with him", "The evidence is overwhelming -
