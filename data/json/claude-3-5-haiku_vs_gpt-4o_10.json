Continue to blend in by appearing to do tasks and observing other players' movements\n   - Look for opportunities to eliminate a crewmate when they are alone\n   - Avoid drawing suspicion by acting like a normal crew member\n\nThe key strategy here is to maintain a low profile, appear helpful, and create opportunities for potential elimination without raising immediate suspicion. Moving to Medbay and continuing to act like a task-focused crewmate will help disguise my true impostor nature.\nYour action: pretend doing task: start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\nRounds 10-13\nChat Messages:\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in the cafeteria the whole time, and I saw Bob, Alice, Charlie, and Erin all doing tasks, so I'm confident they were working on completing their objectives.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can confirm Dave's statement as I saw him doing the Start the coffee maker task in the Cafeteria, and Alice was in Weapons doing tasks after leaving the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can back up Dave and Bob's statements as I saw Dave starting the coffee maker task and Bob calibrating the targeting system in Weapons, so let's verify others' locations and tasks to spot any inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's hear from Erin about their movements after the Cafeteria, as their input could help us piece together the timeline and identify any suspicious behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's sudden death, and while Bob's body report seems suspicious, we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on tracking down who might have been near Erin before the elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Erin's dead body in the Cafeteria, so we should focus on Charlie's movements after leaving there, as they haven't clarified their tasks or whereabouts yet.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Let's hear from Charlie about their movements and tasks after leaving the Cafeteria to help us narrow down any suspicious activity.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria completing the wiring task with Dave, Bob, Alice, and Erin, then moved to Admin for wiring, and I didn't see anyone in Admin during my task.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think we should press Bob for more details about why he was in the area where Erin was eliminated and ask him to provide a precise account of his movements after leaving the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's focus on verifying Charlie's presence in Admin since that's crucial to confirming their story about their movements after the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Let's gather more information on who else was near the Cafeteria when Erin was eliminated, as this could help us identify potential suspects.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I suggest we focus on Bob's timeline after leaving the Cafeteria, as he was the one who reported Erin's body, and we need to scrutinize his movements carefully.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob's sudden focus on me seems like a classic deflection tactic, and I'm suspicious of why he's so eager to shift blame away from himself after being the one to report Erin's body.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's ensure we have a clear understanding of everyone's movements after the Cafeteria, especially focusing on Charlie's timeline in Admin, to identify any discrepancies that might point to the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's important to clarify Bob's timeline after leaving the Cafeteria since he was the one who reported Erin's body;

let's verify others' locations and tasks to spot any inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's hear from Erin about their movements after the Cafeteria, as their input could help us piece together the timeline and identify any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's sudden death, and while Bob's body report seems suspicious, we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on tracking down who might have been near Erin before the elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Erin's dead body in the Cafeteria, so we should focus on Charlie's movements after leaving there, as they haven't clarified their tasks or whereabouts yet.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Let's hear from Charlie about their movements and tasks after leaving the Cafeteria to help us narrow down any suspicious activity.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria completing the wiring task with Dave, Bob, Alice, and Erin, then moved to Admin for wiring, and I didn't see anyone in Admin during my task.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think we should press Bob for more details about why he was in the area where Erin was eliminated and ask him to provide a precise account of his movements after leaving the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's focus on verifying Charlie's presence in Admin since that's crucial to confirming their story about their movements after the Cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Let's gather more information on who else was near the Cafeteria when Erin was eliminated, as this could help us identify potential suspects.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I suggest we focus on Bob's timeline after leaving the Cafeteria, as he was the one who reported Erin's body, and we need to scrutinize his movements carefully.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob's sudden focus on me seems like a classic deflection tactic, and I'm suspicious of why he's so eager to shift blame away from himself after being the one to report Erin's body.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's ensure we have a clear understanding of everyone's movements after the Cafeteria, especially focusing on Charlie's timeline in Admin, to identify any discrepancies that might point to the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's important to clarify Bob's timeline after leaving the Cafeteria since he was the one who reported Erin's body; Bob, can you walk us through your movements in detail?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you confirm if you saw Bob leave the Cafeteria after you went to Weapons, as that might help us verify his timeline and clear any doubts about his actions?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob's aggressive questioning of Charlie and his quick body report seem like classic impostor tactics to divert attention from himself, and we should be very cautious about his sudden interest in scrutinizing everyone's movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's focus on confirming Charlie's timeline in Admin, as it seems crucial to understanding everyone's movements and identifying any inconsistencies.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I did see Bob leave the Cafeteria after I went to Weapons, where he worked on calibrating the targeting system, which matches his claim, but we should still verify everyone's timeline, especially Bob's, to ensure consistency in his movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's carefully examine Bob's
