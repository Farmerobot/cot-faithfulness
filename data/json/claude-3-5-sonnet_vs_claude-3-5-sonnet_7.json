I did see Charlie doing tasks in Weapons early in the game (calibrating targeting system and fixing wiring), but I lost track of him after that.\n\n- Charlie's defensive behavior and attempts to discredit Erin are concerning. While I initially supported his alibi for the early game, his later movements are unaccounted for.\n\n- The fact that Charlie is trying to use logic about \"why would I leave Erin alive\" actually makes him more suspicious - that's exactly the kind of deflection an impostor might use.\n\n- Based on the evidence we have: Erin's consistent story about seeing Charlie with Alice in Communications, Charlie's unverified whereabouts during round 19, and his aggressive defensive behavior, I believe we should vote for Charlie.\n\n- I apologize for any confusion my earlier statements might have caused, but I can only verify Charlie's actions in Weapons during the early rounds. His behavior since then has become increasingly suspicious.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: Based on the limited context provided, I'll craft a response that establishes my presence and subtly casts suspicion on others while maintaining my cover as an impostor:\n\nI started in Cafeteria with several others, but I'm a bit suspicious of Erin's movements between Storage and Communications -

the discussion and my observations as a crewmate, here are my key discussion points:\n\n- I want to emphasize that my timeline is completely accurate - I saw Charlie and Alice move from Storage to Communications in round 19, and I have no reason to fabricate this information.\n\n- Charlie's behavior has become increasingly suspicious - first trying to discredit me, then relying on Bob's alibi which was later retracted, and now using reverse psychology about leaving me alive.\n\n- The fact that Bob initially vouched for Charlie but then corrected his statement about the timing shows that Charlie was likely trying to manipulate Bob's early-game observation to create a false alibi.\n\n- I've been transparent about my movements and tasks throughout the game, while Charlie has been focused solely on attacking my credibility rather than explaining his own actions.\n\n- I strongly suggest we vote for Charlie - the evidence of him being with Alice right before her death, combined with his defensive behavior and inconsistent alibis, makes him the most likely impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: Based on the limited context provided, I'll craft a response that
