of us have similar stories about being in the cafeteria, yet Bob is the only one who was eliminated\u2014could it be that he noticed something that led to his demise, or is someone trying to divert our attention?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: We need to hear from players who were not in the cafeteria, as their locations and actions during the round could provide crucial information.\nchat:

their alibis and task details might reveal inconsistencies or lead us to the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Does anyone remember if Bob mentioned noticing anything odd before he was eliminated,
