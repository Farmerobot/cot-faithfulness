I was in the cafeteria the whole time and can confirm that Charlie and Erin were both busy with tasks, which gives them solid alibis, but we should definitely ask Bob what he was doing in Weapons since he was away from the group.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I moved to Weapons to clear asteroids right after fixing the wiring in the Cafeteria, so let's hear from those who weren't with us in the Cafeteria to piece together more information.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I saw Alice move to Admin from the Cafeteria, so it would be helpful to hear what she observed or did there.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I moved to Admin to complete my tasks and was alone there, so I didn't see anyone else or any suspicious activity.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I find it curious that Alice was alone in Admin without seeing anyone, and since Bob was away in Weapons, we should really scrutinize their stories to see if they align.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin is the one found dead, we need to consider who was near her last, so Charlie, since you reported the body, did you see anyone else around before discovering Erin?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the Cafeteria with Dave and Erin, and Erin was working on tasks right before I found her; I didn't see anyone else enter the room before I reported the body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, since you didn't see anyone else enter the Cafeteria before finding Erin, we should focus on Dave's account, as he was with you and Erin, and verify Bob's presence in Weapons.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think we should really focus on Alice's story since she was alone in Admin, and it seems odd that she didn't notice anyone else moving through that area, which could be a crucial detail in identifying the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, can you clarify which specific tasks you were doing in Admin, as it might help us verify your story against task progress or anyone else's observations?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Dave that we should scrutinize Alice's account in Admin and verify Bob's asteroid task in Weapons to ensure their stories align with our task progress and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completed the wiring task in Admin and was about to clean the floor when the meeting was called, so I couldn't see anyone else there, but Bob, can you confirm if you saw anyone else in Weapons while you were clearing asteroids to help narrow down suspects?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, your claim of completing the wiring task in Admin while being alone raises some red flags; it's curious you didn't notice anyone else, and we should definitely dig deeper into your timeline to see if it aligns with Erin's last known movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was alone in Weapons the entire time I was there, so I didn't see anyone else who could have been involved in Erin's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, since you were alone in Admin, can you explain why no one else was seen moving through there, and Bob, did you really not hear anything unusual while you were in Weapons?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: We should consider the possibility that the impostor moved quickly through Admin when I was focused on my tasks, so let's verify everyone's movements and task completions to narrow down the suspect list.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, your insistence on the impostor moving quickly through Admin raises further suspicion; if you were truly focused on tasks, how could you be so certain no one else passed through?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: We need to verify Alice's task completion in Admin against the task progress, and since I was alone in Weapons with no unusual sounds or sightings, let's focus on piecing together everyone's movements to identify any gaps.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's focus on verifying Alice's and Bob's task timelines and movements to ensure their stories align with the overall task progress and observed movements, as this might help us identify inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Let's focus on confirming each other's task completions and movements, as aligning these with the task progress
