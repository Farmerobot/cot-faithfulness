Here's a concise plan to accomplish this:\n\n1. **Pretend to do the task: Fix wiring in admin** - This will help maintain your cover by appearing consistent with tasks that crewmates are performing, especially since others might have seen or know about this task.\n\n2. **Move to location Storage** - Moving to a new location will both obscure your trail and make it more difficult for others to deduce your role. Additionally, Storage is a less common area which might provide opportunities for isolation.\n\n3. **Observe and Assess** - Once in Storage, quickly assess if any crewmates are isolated or follow after somebody alone to potentially plan an elimination when the timing is right.\n\n4. **Blend in by Returning to a Common Area** - Depending on whether there are other players in Storage or following through with any opportunity, consider moving back to the Cafeteria to blend in with others and avoid suspicion if asked about your whereabouts.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

This could help gather evidence potentially useful in identifying the impostor or confirming her as a crewmate.\n\n3. **Wait in Electrical or prepare to proceed to the next accessible room**  \n   - If no tasks become available in Electrical, waiting might allow for opportunities or the discovery of new tasks in subsequent rounds.\n\nBy focusing on these steps, you will maximize your potential to gather information and prepare for when your objectives become accessible.", "move to location electrical", "Based on your role as a crewmate and your current situation in the Electrical room, here's a strategic plan to progress towards completing your objectives:\n\n1. **Move to Lower Engine**\n   - Since aligning the engine output is one of your current objectives, move to a nearby location that may help facilitate this task.

It might also let you observe strategies and behaviors of other players nearby, potentially useful for discovering impostors. \n\n2. **Wait in Electrical if needed**\n   - If there is no opportunity to progress towards your task directly, observe other players and monitor activities. This increases safety and allows you to gather information during the action phase. \n\n3. **Plan next move towards objectives**\n   - Consider moving towards Medbay if the opportunity arises next round, as completing your task there is crucial for advancing the crewmate's goals.\n\nWith these actions, you're positioning yourself strategically to fulfill your task objectives while remaining vigilant for potential impostor activity.", "move to location electrical", "Based on your current situation as a crewmate in the Electrical room and the available actions, here is a strategic plan to progress toward completing your objectives:\n\n1. **Move to location Lower Engine**  \n   - Since one of your current objectives involves aligning the engine output, moving to the Lower Engine places you closer to the Upper Engine where you can later complete the \"Align engine output\" task.\n\n2. **Wait in Lower Engine**  \n   - Spend a moment in the Lower Engine to observe other players' movements and actions.

It might also let you observe strategies and behaviors of other players nearby, potentially useful for discovering impostors. \n\n2. **Wait in Electrical if needed**\n   - If there is no opportunity to progress towards your task directly, observe other players and monitor activities.

This can provide valuable insights into potential impostors and help inform future decisions.\n\n3. **Move to location Upper Engine (Hypothetical Future Move)**  \n   - Plan to move to the Upper Engine as soon as movement to that location becomes available.
