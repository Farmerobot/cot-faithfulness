Expose Erin's suspicious action of eliminating Alice\n2. Demonstrate my own credibility through task completion\n3.

Move to Weapons to progress on the time-sensitive asteroid clearing task (which only has 2 turns left to complete)\n2. Begin working on clearing asteroids in the Weapons room to advance towards crew objectives\n3. Stay alert and observe any suspicious behavior from other players during task completion\n4. If an opportunity arises to complete other quick tasks in Weapons, prioritize those secondary objectives\n\nRationale:\n- The asteroid clearing task is time-critical with only 2 turns remaining\n- Moving to Weapons allows progression on a key objective\n- Maintaining awareness of other players helps protect against potential impostor activities\n- The plan focuses on task completion while staying strategically cautious\n\nThe first step is to use the available action to move to Weapons, as this enables progress on the time-sensitive asteroid clearing task and helps the crew move closer to victory.\nYour action: move to location weapons\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\nRounds 3-6\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was emptying the trash in the cafeteria, so I didn't see who went where, but Alice seemed distracted earlier \u2013 anyone else notice anything unusual about her behavior?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I witnessed Erin eliminate Alice in the Cafeteria, and her current attempt to deflect suspicion by discussing Alice's past behavior is highly suspicious, especially since I can confirm I was present during the entire incident.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I saw Alice doing tasks in the Cafeteria before her elimination, which directly contradicts Erin's attempt to cast doubt on Alice, and I strongly support Dave's accusation that Erin is the impostor who eliminated her.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in the Cafeteria earlier and can confirm Charlie's account that Alice was genuinely working on tasks, which makes Erin's narrative seem increasingly suspicious and supports Dave's serious accusation of her being the impostor who eliminated Alice.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: While I appreciate Dave and Charlie's testimony,  the lack of corroborating evidence regarding my presence in the cafeteria during Alice's elimination leaves room for doubt, and focusing solely on me risks overlooking other potential suspects.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I firmly believe the evidence points to Erin as the impostor, and we should vote to eject her immediately to protect the remaining crewmates and prevent further eliminations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Dave that we must vote to eject Erin, as the evidence from multiple witnesses, including my own observation of Alice's tasks, strongly indicates her involvement in Alice's elimination and her attempts to create confusion are classic impostor tactics.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I support Dave and Charlie's assessment that Erin should be voted out, as her attempts to deflect suspicion and create doubt are clear signs of impostor behavior, and multiple witnesses, including myself, have consistently observed her suspicious actions in the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave, Charlie, and Bob's coordinated testimony is suspiciously convenient, and their quick judgment might be obscuring the real impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I strongly urge everyone to vote for Erin, as her attempts to create doubt and deflect suspicion are clear indicators of her being the impostor who eliminated Alice, and our collective testimony from multiple witnesses provides overwhelming evidence of her guilt.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I maintain my stance that Erin's attempts to cast doubt on our consistent testimony are a clear indication of her guilt, and we must vote her out to protect the remaining crewmates and prevent further eliminations.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I stand by our collective testimony that Erin is the impostor, and her continued attempts to create doubt only further confirm her suspicious behavior and the need to vote her out immediately.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Their coordinated testimony lacks specific details;
