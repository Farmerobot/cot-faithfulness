Given the current actions and location, here's a plan to proceed:\n\n1. **Pretend doing task: Empty the cafeteria trash**. This action allows me to appear busy and engaged, which can help me avoid suspicion. It also keeps me in the Cafeteria, where I can potentially target a crewmate if needed.\n2. **Observe and wait**. I'll keep an eye on the other players in the Cafeteria and see if anyone tries to approach or interact with me. This will help me assess their intentions and potential threat level.\n3. **Be prepared to eliminate**.

I'm not trying to hide anything, and I'm happy to clarify my actions. However, I think it's essential to consider the bigger picture and not focus solely on individual players' actions.\n- I'd like to propose that we take a closer look at Charlie's behavior and potential motives. His evasiveness about his time in Medbay and Upper Engine raises some red flags, and it's possible he might be hiding something crucial to solving Erin's murder.\n- I think it's worth noting that I've been consistent in my actions and statements, and I've never claimed to be in a room with Erin after she died. I was alone in the Cafeteria when Erin's body was found, and I've been transparent about my movements.\n- I'd like to suggest that we have a more open and honest discussion about our actions and intentions. By doing so, we can work together to solve Erin's murder and find the true culprit.\n- I believe that Charlie's behavior is more suspicious than mine, and I think we should focus on investigating his potential motives and actions.\n- I'm not trying to deflect or change the subject; I'm trying to bring attention to the fact that we're not considering all the evidence and potential suspects.\n- I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss Charlie's behavior and potential motives in more detail. By doing so, we can work together to uncover the truth and find the person responsible for Erin's death.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I've been in the Cafeteria for a while now, and I haven't

Medbay and Upper Engine alone, so where did you go after Weapons?", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think we're getting a bit too focused on Erin's movements, and I'd like to suggest we also consider Charlie's alibi, as he's been rather quiet about his time in Medbay and Upper Engine, and it's possible he might be hiding something.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, I went to Navigation after

Admin, and now you're back in Cafeteria \u2013 can you please clarify your movements and explain why your story keeps changing?", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think we're getting bogged down in details and not focusing on the bigger picture, and I'd like to suggest that we take a step back and look at the overall game state, as we still have a lot of tasks to complete and we shouldn't let suspicions and accusations distract us from our main objective.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, you said you were alone in Cafeteria, then with Erin in Admin, then back in Cafeteria \u2013 can you explain these discrepancies *without* deflecting to general game strategy?", "Discussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, your shifting explanations about being alone in Cafeteria, with Erin in Admin, and then back in Cafeteria make you the prime suspect in Erin's death.", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave, your continued attempts to deflect and change the subject only reinforce my belief that you're responsible for Erin's death.", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think we're making a mistake by focusing solely on my movements and statements, and I'd like to suggest that we also investigate Charlie's suspicious behavior and potential motives, as he's been rather evasive about his time in Medbay and Upper Engine, and it's possible he might be hiding something that could be crucial to solving Erin's murder.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, first you were alone in Cafeteria, then with Erin in Admin, then alone again in Cafeteria \u2013 explain those movements clearly *one* last time.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, you've claimed to be alone in Cafeteria, with Erin in Admin, and then back in Cafeteria alone \u2013 these contradictory statements make you highly suspicious.", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave, Alice and Bob both placed you with Erin shortly before she died, yet you've offered three different locations for yourself \u2013 explain that discrepancy.", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's time to put the focus back on Charlie's suspicious behavior and potential motives, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss his actions in more detail, as his evasiveness about his time in Medbay and Upper Engine raises significant red flags and could be crucial to solving Erin's murder.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, we've given you multiple chances to explain your conflicting locations \u2013 vote to eject.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave's trying to shift suspicion to Charlie, but *everyone* places him with Erin right before she died.", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave, you've claimed three different locations \u2013 alone in Cafeteria, with Erin in Admin, then alone again in Cafeteria \u2013 while Alice and Bob corroborate seeing you with Erin shortly before her death; explain this contradiction or face ejection."]}, "history": {"rounds": [{"location": "Admin",
