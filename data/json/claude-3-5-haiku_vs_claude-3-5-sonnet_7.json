where exactly have you been, Dave?\n[Bob]: While I understand Dave's suspicions, I can account for every step of my path from Cafeteria through Weapons and beyond, and Alice can verify my movements and task completion - so Dave, I have to ask, why are you so focused on me when you've been mostly unseen since the start?\n[Dave]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's death and want to understand exactly what happened, so Alice, can you provide more specific details about the circumstances of finding her body?\n[Alice]: I found Erin's body near the south entrance of Cafeteria, and I'm absolutely certain Bob couldn't have done it since he had just entered from Medbay when I discovered it, which makes me more suspicious of Dave's persistent accusations against Bob.\n[Bob]: Since Alice has confirmed my alibi and witnessed me entering from Medbay when Erin's body was found, I think we need to focus on Dave's whereabouts during that critical time period.\n[Dave]: I noticed Alice and Bob seem unusually coordinated in their defense, which makes me suspect they might be working together to divert attention from their own potential involvement in Erin's elimination.\n[Alice]: I've been completely transparent about following Bob and finding Erin's body, while Dave keeps deflecting and making baseless accusations about coordination - if anyone's behavior is suspicious here, it's his constant dodging of questions about his own whereabouts.\n[Bob]: Dave's attempt to paint my verified movements as suspicious while failing to account for his own location during Erin's death is exactly what an impostor would do to create confusion and doubt.\n[Dave]: I find it suspicious that Alice claims to have been \"shadowing\" Bob so precisely, which seems more like a rehearsed cover story designed to create an airtight alibi for both of them, and I believe we should scrutinize their overly synchronized narrative more closely.\n[Alice]: I've been completely transparent about my movements while Dave continues to avoid explaining where he was when Erin's body was found, which makes his accusations about \"rehearsed\" stories seem like desperate deflection.\n[Bob]: Given Dave's continued evasion about his own location and his desperate attempts to discredit both Alice and me, I think it's clear he's trying to create confusion to hide the fact that he killed Erin in Cafeteria while Alice and I were verifiably elsewhere.\n[Dave]: I'm willing to explain my movements, but first, I want to understand why Bob and Alice seem so synchronized in their accusations against me, which feels more calculated than genuine concern about finding Erin's killer.\n[Alice]: Since Dave keeps dodging questions about his location during Erin's death while trying to paint my legitimate observations as suspicious, I think we need to focus on voting him out before he can eliminate anyone else.\n[Bob]: The evidence is clear - Alice can verify my location in Medbay when Erin's body was found, while Dave continues to dodge questions about his whereabouts and desperately tries to paint our legitimate testimonies as suspicious coordination.\n\nAvailable Voting Options:\n- vote for Nobody\n- vote for Alice\n- vote for Bob\n\nNote that you should NOT vote for Charlie, Erin as they are already out of the game.

Why are Alice and Bob so perfectly aligned in their statements?\n- Alice claims she's been \"shadowing\" Bob for rounds - that's not normal crewmate behavior. What is she really trying to prove?\n- I'm asking legitimate questions about Erin's death, and instead of providing clear answers, they're attacking me\n- Their narrative feels rehearsed.

he keeps deflecting questions about his own whereabouts and trying to paint my truthful observations of Bob's activities as some kind of \"synchronized defense.\"\n\n- Let me be crystal clear about the timing: I discovered Erin's body near the south entrance of Cafeteria just as Bob was entering from Medbay, which means Bob couldn't have been responsible. Dave still hasn't explained where he was during this critical time.\n\n- Dave's strategy seems to be creating doubt about my and Bob's legitimate observations while providing zero explanation for his own movements or activities. This is classic impostor behavior - deflecting and creating confusion rather than providing clear alibis.\n\n- I propose we vote for Dave based on his evasive behavior, refusal to account for his whereabouts during Erin's death, and his attempts to discredit clear eyewitness accounts of Bob's legitimate activities.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I think Bob's movements between Weapons and the cafeteria seem a bit erratic, and we should pay close attention to his actions during the last round.\n[Alice]: I've been shadowing Bob for several rounds and can confirm he's been legitimately completing tasks in Weapons and other rooms -

on the discussion and my observations as a crewmate, here are my key discussion points:\n\n- I want to emphasize that my movements have been completely transparent and verifiable by Alice, who has witnessed me completing legitimate tasks throughout multiple locations\n- The fact that Dave continues to dodge questions about his own whereabouts while trying to paint Alice's corroboration of my movements as \"suspicious coordination\" is very telling\n- I was in Medbay when Erin's body was discovered near Cafeteria's south entrance, which Alice can confirm, making it impossible for me to be the killer\n- Dave's strategy seems to be creating doubt about Alice and me rather than explaining where he was during the critical time of Erin's death\n- I strongly believe we need to vote for Dave,
