This helps maintain a believable crewmate persona.\n2. **Observe:** While pretending to complete the task, watch for other players entering the Cafeteria.  Note their behavior and try to identify potential crewmates.\n3. **Move strategically:** Depending on the observations from step 2, choose to move to either Medbay, Admin, or Weapons.

can you just tell us where you were when Erin was eliminated to clear up these suspicions?\n- I find it troubling that you haven't provided a clear alibi for your whereabouts during Erin's elimination, especially since you were present in Medbay with her just before it happened.\n- Charlie, I agree with your point; Alice's reluctance to specify her actions makes it hard to trust her claims of innocence. We need to focus on her movements more closely.\n- Let's not forget that Alice was the last person seen with Erin before the elimination; if we can establish a timeline, it might expose inconsistencies in her story.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I've been focusing on completing tasks, so I haven't had much time to observe others closely, but I did see Bob in Medbay a couple of times;
