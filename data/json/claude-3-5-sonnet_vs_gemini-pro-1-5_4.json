I started in Cafeteria doing tasks with Bob and Erin present, then moved through Weapons and O2 to Navigation, and finally came back through Weapons to Admin where I saw Erin cleaning.\n\n- Dave's attempt to deflect attention to me is a classic impostor tactic when they're cornered. I've been openly sharing my observations, while Dave keeps changing his story about Upper Engine.\n\n- The fact that Dave first denied being in Upper Engine completely, then admitted being there alone, and now claims he was with Bob in Medbay shows a pattern of deception that we can't ignore.\n\n- I think we have enough evidence with Dave's contradictory statements and both Alice and Bob independently confirming they saw him in Upper Engine.

why would they both make up the exact same story?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, if you weren't in Upper Engine, where *were* you, and can anyone confirm that?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, your denial is unconvincing, and makes you look suspicious, especially since both Alice and I saw you in Upper Engine.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Medbay with Bob, then briefly in Upper Engine alone, and neither of us did Check Catalyzer, so Alice is clearly lying.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's story just keeps changing - first he wasn't in Upper Engine at all, and now he admits being there alone, which directly contradicts what both Alice and Bob independently confirmed about seeing him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, you initially denied being in Upper Engine, then admitted to being there alone\u2014why did your story change, and why should we believe this new version?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, your constantly shifting story about Upper Engine is highly suspicious, and makes it seem like you're trying to cover something up.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, why haven't you mentioned seeing me in Medbay when you know I was there, and why are you backing up Alice's lie about Upper Engine?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's telling that Dave is now claiming he was in Medbay with Bob, when Bob has been consistently saying he only saw Dave in Upper Engine -
