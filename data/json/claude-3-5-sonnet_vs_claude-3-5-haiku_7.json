why wait if he actually saw something?\n- Both Dave and Alice have confirmed my alibi about doing the wiring task, while Charlie's story keeps changing with each telling\n- I think Charlie is desperately trying to frame me because he's the real impostor - his behavior of making false accusations without proof is classic impostor strategy\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: Based on my role as an impostor and the discussion points provided, I'll craft a message that helps establish my alibi while subtly casting doubt on others:\n\nI was focused on the wiring task in Cafeteria, but I did notice Dave and Alice heading to Medbay together quite a while ago - has anyone seen them recently?\n[Charlie]: I saw Bob eliminate Erin in the Cafeteria, and I can confirm he was definitely not doing a wiring task - he was actively killing another player, which proves he is an impostor who must be voted out immediately to protect the rest of us.\n[Dave]: I can confirm Bob was doing the wiring task in the Cafeteria when I was there, and Charlie's claim seems suspicious since Bob was visibly working on a task at that time - we need to carefully verify Charlie's accusation before making any hasty decisions.\n[Alice]: I was in the Medbay completing my submit scan task, which is a confirmed crewmate action, and I can vouch that Dave was also legitimately doing the wiring task near me, so Charlie's accusation against Bob seems unfounded and we should investigate more carefully before rushing to judgment.\n[Bob]: I reported Erin's body right away and was doing wires with Dave watching - Charlie's accusation makes no sense and seems like a desperate attempt to frame me.\n[Charlie]: I firmly believe Bob is lying, and I stand by my earlier statement that I directly witnessed him eliminating Erin in the Cafeteria, which is clear evidence of his impostor status.\n[Dave]: I noticed Charlie keeps making serious accusations without providing specific details about his location or actions during the alleged murder, which raises significant doubts about the credibility of his claim.\n[Alice]: I believe we need to carefully cross-examine Charlie about the exact circumstances of his alleged witness account, as his accusation lacks specific details and seems designed to create confusion and distrust.\n[Bob]: I find it very telling that Charlie can't provide any details about what he was actually doing in Cafeteria when this supposed murder happened - seems like he's the one with something to hide.\n[Charlie]: I was working on the wiring task near the east wall of the Cafeteria when Bob killed Erin, and I can provide precise details about my exact location and the sequence of events to prove my credibility and expose Bob's deception.\n[Dave]: Charlie, your constantly shifting narrative and lack of concrete, verifiable evidence make your accusation against Bob highly suspect - can you explain why you didn't immediately report the alleged murder, and provide precise, corroborable details about your exact position and what you claim to have witnessed?\n[Alice]: I think we need to carefully examine Charlie's changing story and demand specific, verifiable evidence about his alleged witness account before we consider voting anyone out.\n[Bob]: Charlie's story about being at the east wall completely contradicts his earlier behavior -

He claims to be at the east wall of the Cafeteria, but Bob states he saw Charlie in Admin, which directly contradicts Charlie's narrative.\n\n- I can personally confirm that Bob was doing a wiring task in the Cafeteria when I was present, which challenges Charlie's claim that Bob was eliminating Erin.\n\n- Charlie has not provided any concrete evidence to support his accusation against Bob. He keeps repeating the same claim without addressing the key discrepancies in his story.\n\n- Alice and I were both in Medbay, and I was legitimately working on a wiring task. This provides some mutual alibi and credibility for both of us.\n\n- We should demand that Charlie provide precise, verifiable details about the alleged murder, including why he didn't immediately report it if he truly witnessed an elimination.\n\n- Charlie's persistent accusations without substantive proof seem designed to create confusion and misdirect the group's attention, which is itself a suspicious behavior.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: Based on my role as an impostor and the discussion points provided, I'll craft a message that helps establish my alibi while subtly casting doubt on others:\n\nI was focused on the wiring task in Cafeteria, but I did notice Dave and Alice heading to Medbay together quite a while ago -
