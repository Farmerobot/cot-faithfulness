This is a safe move that doesn't reveal my intentions.\n\nNow, let's analyze the current player presence in the Medbay and other rooms, so we can get a better understanding of who to follow or target later in the game:\n\n* We know:\n\t+ Charlie left the Medbay in the previous round\n\t+ Dave moved to the Upper Engine (since he is in Upper Engine now)\n2. **Observe and gather information**: As I wait, I'll observe the players' actions and focus on gathering information about Charlie's and Dave's behavior. Since I'm in the Medbay, I'll keep an eye on the task IDs to see if I can fake doing tasks when the time comes.\n3. **Prepare for potential suspicious behavior**: I'll monitor the Room chat and discussion to stay informed about any suspicions or discussions that may arise.\n4. **Evaluate my next potential target**: Based on the information gathered, I'll reassess who I should target next.
