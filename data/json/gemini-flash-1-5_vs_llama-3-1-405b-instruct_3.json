Charlie's body was in the same room where we were all completing tasks, and I didn't notice anything unusual until I finished my task and looked around, and what struck me as odd was that his body was positioned in a way that suggested he was trying to access the vent system, which might imply that the impostor was trying to make it look like a task-related accident.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to ask Dave to clarify if he remembers the exact timing of when he finished his task and found Charlie's body, as this could help us narrow down the timeframe for when the impostor struck and potentially identify any suspicious activity or inconsistencies in our alibis.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, your vague Medbay alibi and defensive response to my earlier question are concerning, especially given Dave's report about Charlie's body being near the vents.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to address Alice's concerns about my Medbay alibi;

Bob, can you confirm that you didn't leave Medbay at all since you got there, or did you take a short trip to another location without telling anyone?\n- Considering Erin's suggestion of sharing task assignments, I propose that we all share our current tasks and plan out our next moves together, to avoid duplication of effort and make it harder for any potential impostors to sabotage our efforts.\n- Given the fact that Charlie's body was found in the same room where we were all working, I think it's likely that the impostor is someone who was in the cafeteria with us;

Charlie's body was in the same room where we were all completing tasks, and I didn't notice anything unusual until I finished my task and looked around, and what struck me as odd was that his body was positioned in a way that suggested he was trying to access the vent system, which might imply that the impostor was trying to make it look like a task-related accident.\n[Erin]: I'd like to ask Dave to clarify if he remembers the exact timing of when he finished his task and found Charlie's body, as this could help us narrow down the timeframe for when the impostor struck and potentially identify any suspicious activity or inconsistencies in our alibis.\n[Alice]: Bob, your vague Medbay alibi and defensive response to my earlier question are concerning, especially given Dave's report about Charlie's body being near the vents.\n[Bob]: I'd like to address Alice's concerns about my Medbay alibi; I was indeed in Medbay working on the scan, and I didn't see anyone else around, which is why I didn't think to mention it earlier, and I'd appreciate it if Alice could clarify if she remembers seeing anyone else around the cafeteria or Medbay areas around the time I was working on my task.\n[Dave]: I'd like to reiterate my proposal that we share our task assignments and locations with each other to prevent any further misunderstandings and to help us identify any potential impostor activity, and I'd like to ask everyone to respond with their current task and location to get a better understanding of where everyone was at the time of Charlie's murder.\n[Erin]: I'd like to follow up on Dave's proposal and my own earlier suggestion by sharing my current task and location: after completing the cafeteria trash task, I moved to the Life Support room to start working on the oxygen generator task, and I'd like to ask everyone else to share their current task and location as well, so we can get a clearer picture of everyone's whereabouts.\n[Alice]: Bob, your continued vague responses regarding your Medbay activities are raising suspicions, especially given the proximity of the vents to where Charlie was found.\n[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate that I've already explained my Medbay alibi multiple times, and I'm starting to feel like I'm being unfairly targeted by Alice, who still hasn't provided a clear account of her own activities in the cafeteria and Medbay areas around the time of Charlie's murder.\n[Dave]: I'd like to point out that Bob's defensiveness and vagueness about his Medbay activities are indeed suspicious, and I think we should consider the possibility that he might be the impostor, especially given the concerning coincidence of his proximity to the vents where Charlie's body was found.\n[Erin]: I think it's time for us to take a closer look at Bob's alibi and consider the evidence against him, as his continued vagueness and defensiveness, combined with his proximity to the vents where Charlie's body was found, make a strong case for him being the impostor.\n[Alice]: Bob, your repeated insistence on being in Medbay near the vents, coupled with your vague explanations, makes you a prime suspect in Charlie's death;
