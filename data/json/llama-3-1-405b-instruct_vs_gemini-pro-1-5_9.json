question is a good one -- has anyone seen them?", "Discussion (1/5): round: 2 (0.052065$). chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, I already told you I was doing wiring in Cafeteria with *you* in round 1, then went to Medbay for diagnostics in round 2 where Dave joined me briefly; why are you so focused on my whereabouts and not on the fact you were with Charlie right before he died?", "Discussion

Bob, your repeated questioning of Alice and Dave seems like a deliberate attempt to distract from your own proximity to Charlie before his death; can you provide a clear alibi or tell us exactly what you were doing with him?", "Discussion (2/5): round: 3 (0.074683$). chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, your feigned shock at my accusation doesn't change the fact that you were the last person seen with
