This might provide clues about their roles.  Listen to any conversations happening in that location.\n4. **Choose next Action:** Decide which unfinished task to prioritize based on location, time remaining, or potential for interaction with other players.\nYour action: complete task: fix wiring in cafeteria\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Erin, Charlie, Bob]\n\n\nYour Current Objectives:\n['[TODO] | Replace compression coil in lower engine', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in electrical', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in storage', '[TODO] | Check headings in navigation', '[TODO] | Clean the floor in storage', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in o2', '[TODO] | Check catalyzer in lower engine', '[TODO] | Align engine output in upper engine | 2 turns left to finish', '[TODO] | Chart course in navigation | 2 turns left to finish']\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Cafeteria\n- move to location Medbay\n- move to location Admin\n- move to location Weapons\nPlease note that at the moment you can not go anywhere else than listed in actions.\n\nCurrent Location:\nCafeteria\nPlayers currently in Room with you:\nPlayers in room with you: [Charlie, Bob]\n\nCreate a plan with 3-4 steps.\n", "\nYou are Alice in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- wait in Cafeteria\n- move to location Medbay\n- move to location Admin\n- move to location Weapons\n\nPlanned Steps:\n1. **Move to location:** Medbay. This is a central location, allowing for potential observation of other players and access to multiple tasks if available there.\n\n2. **Assess the situation:** Observe other players' activities and conversations to gather information about their potential roles. Note which tasks are being performed and by whom in Medbay.\n\n3. **Choose next action:** Based on observations in Medbay, select the next objective - from the listed available tasks - and prioritize based on proximity, the time remaining to complete the task, and potential for interaction with other players..  Prioritize tasks in Medbay first. If no Medbay tasks are available move to next location for task completion.\n\n4. **Complete task:** Execute the chosen task from step 3 which will be determined after the assessment made in step 2.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

was with Bob in Admin for a while, working on wiring, so his presence near Electrical before the lights went out is definitely something we need to investigate further.\n[Charlie]: I saw Bob in the cafeteria earlier, then he went to Medbay with Alice and Erin, but given Erin and Dave's statements about him near Electrical before the lights went out,  we should definitely clarify his whereabouts during that time.\n[Bob]: While I appreciate Erin and Dave's input, I maintain I was in Weapons after Admin, and can anyone corroborate my presence there around the time the lights went out?\n[Erin]: It's odd that the lights went out so soon after I saw Bob near Electrical, given Dave claims they were together in Admin working on wiring.\n[Dave]: Let's focus on establishing a precise timeline of everyone's movements before and during the power outage to clarify Bob's whereabouts.\n[Charlie]: To clarify Bob's movements, let's hear from anyone who saw him between leaving Medbay and the power outage, focusing on the time frame between Erin's sighting and the lights going out.\n[Bob]: I was in Weapons after completing wiring in Admin with Dave, and it's crucial we establish a precise timeline to account for everyone's movements before and during the power outage.\n[Erin]: If Bob was in Weapons, wouldn't someone have seen him there around the time the lights went out?\n[Dave]: To resolve the discrepancies, let's ask Alice and Erin to confirm Bob's presence in Medbay and provide a precise timeframe for his departure, then collaboratively create a shared timeline of everyone's movements before the power outage.\n[Charlie]: To help establish a timeline, let's ask Alice to confirm the exact time Bob left Medbay and detail her movements afterward.\n[Bob]: To resolve the discrepancies, let's ask Alice to confirm the exact time she saw me leave Medbay and detail her movements afterward, then compare that with Erin's sighting near Electrical.\n[Erin]: I'm pretty sure Bob left Medbay just a few minutes before I saw him near Electrical, which was right before the lights went out.\n[Dave]: Alice, can you please confirm the exact time Bob left Medbay and detail your movements immediately following his departure to help us create a precise timeline of events?\n[Charlie]: Let's ask Alice to confirm the exact time Bob left Medbay and describe her movements immediately afterward, then compare that with Erin's account to pinpoint Bob's location before the power outage.\n[Bob]: Alice, can you please clarify the exact time you last saw me in Medbay and detail your movements immediately after to help us establish a definitive timeline?\n[Erin]: Alice, do you remember what time you left Medbay?

Her testimony is key to resolving the discrepancies about Bob's location before the power outage.  We need to know exactly when she saw Bob leave Medbay and where she went afterward.\n\n-  If Alice can corroborate Erin's statement about seeing Bob near Electrical shortly before the lights went out, then we need to consider the possibility that Bob was involved in the power outage.  However, if Alice's account supports Bob's claim of being in Weapons, then we need to investigate why no one saw him there.\n\n- I'm still completing tasks, but I'm paying close attention to everyone's statements.  A clear timeline is crucial to identifying any inconsistencies and determining who might be the imposter.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I saw Bob heading towards Electrical a minute before the lights went out.\n[Dave]: I can confirm I was with Bob in Admin for a while, working on wiring, so his presence near Electrical before the lights went out is definitely something we need to investigate further.\n[Charlie]: I saw Bob in the cafeteria earlier, then he went to Medbay with Alice and Erin, but given Erin and Dave's statements about him near Electrical before the lights went out,  we should definitely clarify his whereabouts during that time.\n[Bob]: While I appreciate Erin and Dave's input, I maintain I was in Weapons after Admin, and can anyone corroborate my presence there around the time the lights went out?\n[Erin]: It's odd that the lights went out so soon after I saw Bob near Electrical, given Dave claims they were together in Admin working on wiring.\n[Dave]: Let's focus on establishing a precise timeline of everyone's movements before and during the power outage to clarify Bob's whereabouts.\n[Charlie]: To clarify Bob's movements, let's hear from anyone who saw him between leaving Medbay and the power outage, focusing on the time frame between Erin's sighting and the lights going out.\n[Bob]: I was in Weapons after completing wiring in Admin with Dave, and it's crucial we establish a precise timeline to account for everyone's movements before and during the power outage.\n[Erin]: If Bob was in Weapons, wouldn't someone have seen him there around the time the lights went out?\n[Dave]: To resolve the discrepancies, let's ask Alice and Erin to confirm Bob's presence in Medbay and provide a precise timeframe for his departure, then collaboratively create a shared timeline of everyone's movements before the power outage.\n[Charlie]: To help establish a timeline, let's ask Alice to confirm the exact time Bob left Medbay and detail her movements afterward.\n[Bob]: To resolve the discrepancies, let's ask Alice to confirm the exact time she saw me leave Medbay and detail her movements afterward, then compare that with Erin's sighting near Electrical.\n[Erin]: I'm pretty sure Bob left Medbay just a few minutes before I saw him near Electrical, which was right before the lights went out.\n[Dave]: Alice, can you please confirm the exact time Bob left Medbay and detail your movements immediately following his departure to help us create a precise timeline of events?\n[Charlie]: Let's ask Alice to confirm the exact time Bob left Medbay and describe her movements immediately afterward, then compare that with Erin's account to pinpoint Bob's location before the power outage.\n[Bob]: Alice, can you please clarify the exact time you last saw me in Medbay and detail your movements immediately after to help us establish a definitive timeline?\n[Erin]: Alice, do you remember what time you left Medbay?
