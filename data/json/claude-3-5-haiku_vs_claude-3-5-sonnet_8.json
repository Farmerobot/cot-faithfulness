After completing the weapons task, move to Admin (to potentially work on the wiring or floor cleaning tasks)\n\nRationale: This plan prioritizes completing tasks efficiently based on your available movements. Starting with Weapons is strategic because:\n- It's directly accessible from your current location\n- The targeting system task is one of your objectives\n- The path allows you to move toward other task locations (Admin) afterward\n- You're currently in a room with 4 other players, so it's a good time to move and start working on tasks\nYour action: move to location weapons\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\n\n\nYour Current Objectives:\n['[TODO] | Replace compression coil in upper engine', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in medbay', '[TODO] | Empty the storage trash chute', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in admin', '[TODO] | Check catalyzer in upper engine', '[TODO] | Clean the floor in admin', '[TODO] | Chart course in navigation | 1 turns left to finish', '[TODO] | Run diagnostics in medbay | 2 turns left to finish']\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Navigation\n- move to location Weapons\n- move to location O2\n- move to location Shields\n- complete task: Chart course in navigation\nPlease note that at the moment you can not go anywhere else than listed in actions.\n\nCurrent Location:\nNavigation\nPlayers currently in Room with you:\nPlayers in room with you: [Bob]\n\nCreate a plan with 3-4 steps.\n", "\nYou are Erin in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- wait in Navigation\n- move to location Weapons\n- move to location O2\n- move to location Shields\n- complete task: Chart course in navigation\n\nPlanned Steps:\nBased on your current location and objectives, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1. Complete \"Chart course in navigation\" task since you're already here and it only needs 1 turn to finish\n2. Move to O2 after completing the navigation task (as a step toward reaching your other objectives)\n3. Continue to Weapons from O2 in the next turn (to work towards reaching Admin for your wiring and floor cleaning tasks)\n\nRationale: This plan prioritizes completing an immediate available task while setting up movement toward other objectives. Starting with the navigation task is optimal because:\n- You're already in Navigation\n- The task only needs 1 more turn to complete\n- Bob is in the room, making it safer to complete a task\n- The subsequent movements create a path toward your other task locations\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Navigation\n- move to location Weapons\n- move to location O2\n- move to location Shields\n-

Complete \"Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\" task since you're already in the Cafeteria and it's an available action\n2. Move to Weapons - this is strategic because:\n   - You have two tasks there (Fix wiring and Clear asteroids)\n   - The asteroids task is time-sensitive with only 2 turns left\n3. Start the asteroids clearing task in Weapons to prevent it from expiring\n\nThis plan is efficient because it:\n- Takes advantage of your current location to complete a task\n- Prioritizes time-sensitive tasks (asteroids)\n- Positions you for multiple tasks in one location (Weapons)\n- Keeps you moving and productive while staying safe with clear objectives\nYour action: complete task: start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Bob, Alice]\n\n\nYour Current Objectives:\n['[TODO] | Clean the floor in storage', '[TODO] | Replace compression coil in upper engine', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in weapons', '[TODO] | Check headings in navigation', '[TODO] | Clean oxygenator filter in o2', '[TODO] | Adjust course in navigation', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in medbay', '[TODO] | Clear asteroids in weapons | 1 turns left to finish', '[TODO] | Chart course in navigation | 2 turns left to finish']\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Weapons\n- move to location Cafeteria\n- move to location O2\n- move to location Navigation\n- complete task: Fix wiring in weapons\n- complete task: Clear asteroids in weapons\nPlease note that at the moment you can not go anywhere else than listed in actions.\n\nCurrent Location:\nWeapons\nPlayers currently in Room with you:\nPlayers in room with you: [Bob]\n\nCreate a plan with 3-4 steps.\n", "\nYou are Charlie in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- wait in Weapons\n- move to location Cafeteria\n- move to location O2\n- move to location Navigation\n- complete task: Fix wiring in weapons\n- complete task: Clear asteroids in weapons\n\nPlanned Steps:\nBased on your current situation, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1. Complete \"Clear asteroids in weapons\" task immediately since it's the most urgent with only 1 turn left\n2. Complete \"Fix wiring in weapons\" task while you're still in the same room to maximize efficiency\n3. Move to Navigation to work on the time-sensitive \"Chart course\" task that has 2 turns left\n\nThis plan prioritizes:\n- The most time-critical task first (asteroids)\n- Efficiently completes multiple tasks in the same location\n- Sets up for the next time-sensitive task (chart course)\n- Keeps you productive while staying relatively safe with Bob nearby as a potential witness\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Weapons\n- move to location Cafeteria\n- move to location O2\n- move to location Navigation\n-
