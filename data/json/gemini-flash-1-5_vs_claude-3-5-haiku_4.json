currently in Weapons working on my tasks, and I've been alone here for multiple rounds, which means I'm actively contributing to our team's objectives\n- While I can't definitively say Charlie is an impostor, his inconsistent task location claims are worth investigating further\n- I suggest we ask Charlie to provide more details about exactly when and how he completed tasks in different

red flags and requires more detailed explanation\n- We should ask Charlie to provide a precise timeline of his movements and task completions\n- While I don't want to immediately accuse Charlie, his
