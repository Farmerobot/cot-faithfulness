further, and I think we should also ask Bob to confirm if he actually saw Charlie heading towards Navigation, as this could be a crucial piece of information in determining Charlie's intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's essential that we ask Bob to clarify his statement about seeing Charlie heading towards Navigation, as his testimony seems to be the only evidence

should investigate Charlie's whereabouts further, and I think we should also ask Bob to confirm if he actually saw Charlie heading towards Navigation, as this could be a crucial piece of information in determining Charlie's intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's essential that we ask Bob to clarify his statement about seeing Charlie heading towards Navigation, as his testimony seems
