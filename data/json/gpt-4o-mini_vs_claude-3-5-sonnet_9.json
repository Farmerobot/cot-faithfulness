we were all there together, and their story checks out completely\n- Dave's behavior is very suspicious - he was the last person with Alice, and instead of reporting the body immediately, he tried to cast suspicion on Erin whose movements are well-documented\n- I think we should vote for Dave -

we were all genuinely in Weapons together and can verify each other's presence and actions\n\n- The most suspicious elements are: Dave was last with Alice, delayed reporting her death, and is now trying to create conspiracy theories rather than explain his own actions\n\n- We should focus on the facts: Dave was the last person with Alice, everyone else has corroborated alibis, and Dave's behavior fits classic impostor deflection tactics\n\n- I'm completely certain we should vote for Dave -

confusion with impossible scenarios.", "Discussion (4/5): round: 6 (0.506623$). chat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that Dave is suggesting three impostors are working together shows he doesn't even know basic game rules, which perfectly demonstrates how he's making up increasingly desperate lies to cover his tracks as the real impostor.", "Discussion (4/5): round: 6 (0.56101$). chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since Dave's latest theory about three impostors working together directly contradicts game rules and he's still trying to deflect from being the last person with Alice despite multiple witnesses confirming our locations, I think we have more than enough evidence to vote him out.", "\u001b[90m Player to act next set to: 0 \u001b[00m", "Discussion (5/5): round: 7 (0.563953$). chat: Discussion: [Dave]: Let's not forget that if you all are so certain of each other's alibis, then why not take a moment to consider that I could be a scapegoat in this situation, and if you vote me out, you might just be handing the victory to the real impostor?", "Discussion (5/5): round: 7 (0.635128$). chat: Discussion: [Erin]: The fact that Dave continues to ignore the simple truth - that he was last seen with Alice and delayed reporting her body - while pushing increasingly desperate conspiracy theories shows exactly why we need to vote him out now.", "Discussion (5/5): round: 7
