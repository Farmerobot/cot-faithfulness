left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob, your claim about being in the cafeteria and Medbay contradicts my observation of you eliminating Charlie in Upper Engine, and I think it\u2019s time we seriously consider voting you out based on this clear evidence.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: We need to hear from Charlie to clarify Bob's alibi, as their confirmation is crucial to understanding what really happened in Upper Engine.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Weapons the entire time and didn't see anyone come in or out, so I find it hard to believe Bob's claim, especially given Erin's strong accusation and the need for Charlie's input to clarify the timeline.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I find it highly suspicious that Erin claims to have seen me eliminate Charlie in Upper Engine when I was actually the one who found and reported Charlie's body in Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob, your story continues to shift, and with Dave's solid alibi in Weapons and Alice's uncertainty about your claims, it's clear we need to vote you out before you can eliminate anyone else.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob, your narrative keeps changing, and if Erin truly saw you eliminate Charlie, we need to take her accusation seriously; it's crucial we vote based on the evidence presented.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given the strong evidence against Bob, including Erin's consistent observations and my own solid alibi in Weapons, I believe we should vote to eject Bob to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I want to point out that Dave claims he was in Weapons the whole time, but I distinctly saw him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons earlier, so his \"solid alibi\" isn't as reliable as he wants us to believe.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob, your constant shifting of the narrative just adds to my suspicions, especially since I directly witnessed you eliminate Charlie in Upper Engine, and it\u2019s crucial we act on this evidence to protect the

safeguard the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob's attempts to shift the blame onto me only highlight his desperation; Erin's eyewitness account of his actions is undeniable, and we

We should discuss this further to see if anyone else saw anything suspicious.\n- Bob mentioned that Charlie can confirm his alibi, but I haven't heard Charlie speak up about that yet. We should ask Charlie what they saw.\n- I was in Medbay with Bob and Charlie earlier, and I didn't see any eliminations happen there. It's important to clarify our movements to establish a timeline.\n- If Erin's accusation is true, we need to weigh the evidence carefully before making a vote. It might be beneficial to hear what Bob has to say in response to Erin's claim.", "We need to hear from Charlie to clarify Bob's alibi, as their confirmation is crucial to understanding what really happened in Upper Engine.", "- I think we should focus on the timeline of events; Bob claims he found Charlie's body in Medbay, but Erin is adamant that she saw him eliminate Charlie in Upper Engine. This needs clarification.\n- Bob, if you were in Medbay when you reported the body, how do you explain Erin's accusation? It seems like there\u2019s a significant contradiction that we need to address.\n- Erin, could you elaborate on what you saw? Your testimony is crucial, and if you truly witnessed the elimination, that puts Bob in a very suspicious light.\n- I was in Medbay and saw both you, Bob, and Charlie doing tasks, but now that Charlie is out, it\u2019s important to consider who had the opportunity to eliminate him. \n- Given Dave's solid alibi in Weapons, it makes me question whether Bob could be the impostor here, especially with the inconsistencies in his story.", "Bob, your narrative keeps changing, and if Erin truly saw you eliminate Charlie, we need to take her accusation seriously; it's crucial we vote based on the evidence presented.", "- I agree with Erin that Bob's story is inconsistent and raises a lot of red flags; we can't ignore the evidence against him.\n- It's important that we focus on the facts; Erin claims to have seen Bob eliminate Charlie, and that should weigh heavily in our decision.\n- Bob's attempts to cast doubt on Dave's alibi only seem to deflect from his own suspicious behavior; we need to stay focused on the real issue at hand.\n- I think we should ask Charlie to clarify their observations since their input could provide more context to this situation; their perspective is crucial.\n- With the evidence stacking up against Bob and Erin's consistent claims, I believe it's time to vote him out before he has a chance to eliminate another crewmate.", "Given the mounting evidence against Bob, especially Erin's direct observation and the inconsistencies in his story, I strongly believe we should vote him out to safeguard the remaining crewmates.", "- I agree with Erin and Dave; Bob's narrative is inconsistent, and it's crucial we act on the evidence we've gathered to protect ourselves.\n- Bob's shifting story raises red flags, and we can't afford to let him continue to manipulate the situation; voting him out seems to be the safest option.\n- We should emphasize Erin's eyewitness account during the vote, as it is a strong piece of evidence against Bob that we cannot ignore.\n- If Bob is allowed to stay, he could potentially eliminate more crewmates; we must prioritize our safety by voting him out now.", "Bob, your attempts to deflect blame only
