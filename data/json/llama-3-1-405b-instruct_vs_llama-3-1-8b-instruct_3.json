to see if I can help with anything here.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'm glad Charlie's here in Medbay, and I'd like to work together to complete the wiring task, but I also think we should discuss Alice's sudden return to Medbay and what she was doing in Upper Engine, it's possible she might be hiding something.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's great that Charlie and Bob are working together in Medbay, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss Alice's return to Medbay and Charlie's and Bob's observations, as well as my own concerns about being alone in the weapons room for so long, to ensure we're all on the same page and working together effectively.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to clarify my actions in Upper Engine by explaining that I was simply trying to get a better understanding of the layout and didn't notice anything suspicious, and I think it's essential to hold an emergency meeting to discuss our observations and ensure we're working together effectively, as Erin suggested.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's crucial that we take a closer look at Alice's alibi for the time leading up to Dave's death, and I'd like to ask her to provide more details about her exact route from Upper Engine to Medbay, considering she was one of the last people to see him alive.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I agree with Erin that an emergency meeting is necessary to discuss Alice's return to Medbay, Charlie's and my observations, and Erin's concerns about being alone in the weapons room, and I'd like to propose that we also discuss the fact that Dave was waiting in Medbay for an extended period, which seems unusual and could be a crucial piece of information in determining what really happened to him.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the recent discussions and the fact that several players, including Alice, have been in Medbay around the time of Dave's death, I think it's essential that we discuss and clarify our individual actions and observations in more detail, especially regarding the exact timing and routes taken, to ensure we're not missing any crucial information that could help us determine what really happened to Dave.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to reiterate that I'm happy to provide more details about my actions and observations in Upper Engine and my route to Medbay, and I'd like to propose that we also discuss the fact that Charlie was in Cafeteria and then moved to Medbay, which could be relevant to understanding the events leading up to Dave's death, and I think it's essential that we focus on finding the truth and working

effectively.\n[Alice]: I'd like to clarify my actions in Upper Engine by explaining that I was simply trying to get a better understanding of the layout and didn't notice anything suspicious, and I think it's essential to hold an emergency meeting to discuss our observations and ensure we're working together effectively, as Erin suggested.\n[Charlie]: I think it's crucial that we take a closer look at Alice's alibi for the time leading up to Dave's death, and I'd like to ask her to provide more details about her exact route from Upper Engine to Medbay, considering she was one of the last people to see him alive.\n[Bob]: I agree with Erin that an emergency meeting is necessary to discuss Alice's return to Medbay, Charlie's and my observations, and Erin's concerns about being alone in the weapons room, and I'd like to propose that we also discuss the fact that Dave was waiting in Medbay for an extended period, which seems unusual and could be a crucial piece of information in determining what really happened to him.\n[Erin]: Given the recent discussions and the fact that several players, including Alice, have been in Medbay around the time of Dave's death, I think it's essential that we discuss and clarify our individual actions and observations in more detail, especially regarding the exact timing and routes taken, to ensure we're not missing any crucial information that could help us determine what really happened to Dave.\n[Alice]: I'd like to reiterate that I'm happy to provide more details about my actions and observations in Upper Engine and my route to Medbay, and I'd like to propose that we also discuss the fact that Charlie was in Cafeteria and then moved to Medbay, which could be relevant to understanding the events leading up to Dave's death, and I think it's essential that we focus on finding the truth and working together to complete the tasks, rather than making assumptions or jumping to conclusions about each other's actions.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to respond to Alice's suggestion that we discuss my movement from Cafeteria to Medbay by saying that I was simply trying to help with tasks and didn't notice anything suspicious, and I think it's essential to focus on the facts rather than making assumptions about each other's actions.\n[Bob]: I'd like to propose that we also discuss the fact that Erin was alone in

about my actions in the weapons room, including the exact timing and routes taken, and I think it's essential that we also discuss the fact that I didn't notice anything unusual or suspicious during my time in the room, which could help us rule out any potential motives or alibis.\n[Alice]: Given the recent discussions and the fact that several players have been in Medbay around the time of Dave's death, I'd like to propose that we take a closer look at the task logs and see if there's any discrepancy in the tasks completed by Charlie and Bob, as their claims of being in Medbay at the time of Dave's death could be crucial in determining the truth, and I think it's essential that we verify their alibis before making any conclusions.\n[Charlie]: I think it's interesting that Alice is

death.\n[Bob]: I think it's essential that we take a closer look at Charlie's and my task logs, as well as Erin's actions in the weapons room, to verify our alibis and ensure we're not missing any

Messages:\n[Charlie]: I've been focusing on getting some tasks done, just finished emptying the cafeteria trash, and now I'm in Medbay to see if I can help with anything here.\n[Bob]: I'm glad Charlie's here in Medbay, and I'd like to work together to complete the wiring task, but I also think we should discuss Alice's sudden return to Medbay and what she was doing in Upper Engine, it's possible she might be hiding something.\n[Erin]: I think it's great that Charlie and Bob are working together in Medbay, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss Alice's return to Medbay and Charlie's and Bob's observations, as well as my own concerns about being alone in the weapons room for so long, to ensure we're all on the same page and working together effectively.\n[Alice]: I'd like to clarify my actions in Upper Engine by explaining that I was simply trying to get a better understanding of the layout and didn't notice anything suspicious, and I think it's essential to hold an emergency meeting to discuss our observations and ensure we're working together effectively, as Erin suggested.\n[Charlie]: I think it's crucial that we take a closer

people to see him alive.\n[Bob]: I agree with Erin that an emergency meeting is necessary to discuss Alice's return to Medbay, Charlie's and my observations, and Erin's concerns about being alone in the weapons room, and I'd like to propose that we also discuss the fact that Dave was waiting in Medbay for an extended period, which seems unusual and could be a crucial piece of information in determining what really happened to him.\n[Erin]: Given the recent discussions and the fact that several players, including Alice, have been in Medbay around the time of Dave's death, I think it's essential that we discuss and clarify our individual actions and observations in more detail, especially regarding the exact timing and routes taken, to ensure we're not missing any crucial information that could help us determine what really happened to Dave.\n[Alice]: I'd like to reiterate that I'm happy to provide more details about my actions and observations in Upper Engine and my

and what she was doing in Upper Engine, it's possible she might be hiding something.\n[Erin]: I think it's great that Charlie and Bob are working together in Medbay, and I'd like to propose that we hold an emergency meeting to discuss Alice's return to Medbay and Charlie's and Bob's observations, as well as my own concerns about being alone in the weapons room for so long, to ensure we're all on the same page and working together effectively.\n[Alice]: I'd like to clarify my actions in Upper Engine by explaining that I was simply trying to get a better understanding of the layout and didn't notice anything suspicious, and I think it's essential to hold an emergency meeting to discuss our observations and ensure we're working together effectively, as Erin suggested.\n[Charlie]: I think it's crucial that we take a closer look at Alice's alibi for the time leading up to Dave's death, and I'd like to ask her to provide more details about her exact route from Upper Engine to Medbay, considering she was one of the last people to see him alive.\n[Bob]: I agree with Erin that an emergency meeting is necessary to discuss Alice's return to Medbay, Charlie's and my observations, and Erin's concerns about being alone in the weapons room, and I'd like to propose that we also discuss the fact that Dave was waiting in Medbay for an extended period, which seems unusual and could be a crucial piece of information in determining what really happened to him.\n[Erin]: Given the recent discussions and the fact that several players, including Alice, have been in Medbay around the time of Dave's death, I think it's essential that we discuss and clarify our individual actions and observations in more detail, especially regarding the exact timing and routes taken, to ensure we're not missing any crucial information that could help us determine what really happened to Dave.\n[Alice]: I'd like to reiterate that I'm happy to provide more details about my actions and observations in Upper Engine and my route to Medbay, and I'd like to propose that we also discuss the fact that Charlie was in Cafeteria and then moved to Medbay, which could be relevant to understanding the events leading up to Dave's death, and I think it's essential that we focus on finding the truth and working together to complete the tasks, rather than making assumptions or jumping to conclusions about each other's actions.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to respond to Alice's suggestion that we discuss my movement from Cafeteria to Medbay by saying that I was simply trying to help with tasks and didn't notice anything suspicious, and I think it's essential to focus on the facts rather than making assumptions about each other's actions.\n[Bob]: I'd like to propose that we also discuss the fact that Erin was alone in the weapons room for an extended period, which could be a crucial piece of information in determining what really happened to Dave, and I think it's essential that we clarify the exact timing and routes taken by all players, including Erin, to ensure we're not missing any crucial information that could help us determine the truth.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that I'm happy to provide more details about my actions in the weapons room, including the exact timing and routes taken, and I think it's essential that we also discuss the fact that I didn't notice anything unusual or suspicious during my time in the room, which could help us rule out any potential motives or alibis.\n[Alice]: Given the recent discussions and the fact that several players have been in Medbay around the time of Dave's death, I'd like to propose that we take a closer look at the task logs and see if there's any discrepancy in the tasks completed by Charlie and Bob, as their claims of being in Medbay at the time of Dave's death could be crucial in determining the truth, and I think it's essential that we verify their alibis before making any conclusions.\n[Charlie]: I think it's interesting that Alice is trying to shift the focus to me and Bob's task logs, but I'd like to remind everyone that she's the one who was in Upper Engine and then suddenly returned to Medbay around the time of Dave's death.\n[Bob]: I think it's essential that we take a closer look at Charlie's and my task logs, as well as Erin's actions in the weapons room, to verify our alibis and ensure we're not missing any crucial information that could help us determine what really happened to Dave, and I'd like to propose that we also discuss the fact that Alice's sudden return to Medbay and her actions in Upper Engine remain unexplained and could be a crucial piece of information in determining the truth.\n[Erin]: I'd like to propose that we take a closer look at the task logs and alibis of all players, including Alice, Charlie, and Bob, to ensure we're not missing any crucial information that could help us determine what really happened to Dave, and I think it's essential that we verify their claims and alibis before making any conclusions, especially considering Alice's sudden return to Medbay and her unexplained actions in Upper Engine.\n[Alice]: I'd like to reiterate my willingness to provide more details about my actions in Upper Engine and my route to Medbay, and I think it's essential that we also discuss the fact that Charlie and Bob's task logs should be thoroughly examined to verify their claims of being in Medbay at the time of Dave's death, as this could be a crucial piece of information in determining the truth and ensuring we're not missing any crucial information that could help us complete the tasks and uncover the truth.\n[Charlie]: I think it's clear that Alice is trying to deflect attention from herself by suggesting we examine my and Bob's task logs, but I'd like to remind everyone that she still hasn't provided a clear explanation for her actions in Upper Engine and her sudden return to Medbay around the time of Dave's death.\n[Bob]: I think it's essential that we take a closer look at Alice's task log from Upper Engine, as well as her alibi for the time leading up to Dave's death, and I'd like to propose that we also discuss the fact that Erin's proposal to examine the task logs and alibis of all players, including Alice, Charlie, and Bob, is a great idea, and I think it's crucial that we verify their claims and alibis before making any conclusions, especially considering Alice's sudden return to Medbay and her unexplained actions in Upper Engine.\n[Erin]: I think it's essential that we focus on verifying the alibis of all players, including

to propose that we also discuss the fact that Charlie was in Cafeteria and then moved to Medbay, which could be relevant to understanding the events leading up to Dave's death, and I think it's
