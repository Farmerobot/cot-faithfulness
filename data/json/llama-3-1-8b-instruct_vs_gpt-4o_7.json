considering I've been in the same room for a while and haven't seen any signs of her doing any actual work, maybe we should investigate further.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the Cafeteria doing tasks for most of the time and just moved to Medbay, Alice, can you clarify what tasks you've been doing there and why you didn't see me arrive?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Let's focus on completing our tasks quickly and keep track of each other's movements, as this will help us narrow down any suspicious behavior, especially since Erin was doing tasks in the Cafeteria before moving to Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, you mentioned being in Medbay for a while\u2014can you clarify what tasks you were working on there, as it might help clear up the situation with Erin?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I've been working on a task in Medbay, but I think we're getting a bit sidetracked, let's focus on the fact that Erin just arrived in Medbay and hasn't been doing any actual work, I think we should prioritize investigating her suspicious behavior over clarifying my tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, your reluctance to detail your tasks in Medbay while focusing solely on me is concerning\u2014can anyone else verify her actions there?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Dave: Alice, it's important for everyone to be transparent, so could you please confirm whether you saw Bob in Medbay earlier, and share more about your activities there?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you clarify if you saw anyone else, like Bob, in Medbay before Erin arrived?

Alice's reluctance to clarify her own activities in Medbay is increasingly suspicious.\n- We should establish a protocol for verifying tasks, but this starts with Alice clarifying her activities in Medbay. Transparency is key to identifying impostors.\n- Dave and I have both asked Alice to confirm if she saw Bob in Medbay before Erin arrived.
