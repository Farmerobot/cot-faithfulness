I personally saw Dave doing the Fix Wiring task in Cafeteria during round 1\n- Erin's accusation about Dave in Electrical seems questionable since I saw Dave move from Cafeteria to Medbay, not Electrical\n- I've been tracking Dave's movements: he was in Cafeteria doing tasks, then moved to Medbay. This timeline doesn't match Erin's story\n- Alice has been near me for most rounds - I saw her empty trash in Cafeteria, then do the coffee maker task, and now she's in Weapons with me and Bob\n- I find it suspicious that Erin is making claims about Dave that don't match what multiple people observed", "I can back up Bob's statement - I personally watched Dave complete the wiring task in Cafeteria and then head to Medbay, which directly contradicts Erin's claim about seeing him in Electrical.", "Based on the game history and my observations as a crewmate, here are my discussion points:\n\n- I want to firmly reiterate what I saw - Dave was definitely in Cafeteria doing the wiring task, and I watched him move to Medbay. This isn't coordinated testimony, it's simply the truth.\n\n- Erin's attempt to deflect by suggesting Bob and I coordinated our stories is particularly suspicious, especially since Alice also confirms our account.\n\n- The timeline is clear: Dave was in Cafeteria doing wiring, then moved to Medbay. The fact that Erin claims to have seen him in Electrical during this time is impossible.\n\n- I think it's significant that Erin reported the body but is also the only one with a story that contradicts three other witnesses. This feels like she's trying to create confusion around Dave's death.\n\n- Given the evidence, I strongly believe we should vote for Erin. Her story doesn't match reality, and she's trying to discredit multiple witnesses by suggesting conspiracy.", "The fact that Erin is trying to paint three independent witnesses as conspirators while being the only one with a contradictory story about Dave's location makes her extremely suspicious, and I think we need to vote her out.", "Based on the discussion and my observations as a crewmate, here are my discussion points:\n\n- Erin's sudden backtracking about Dave's location is extremely concerning - first she was certain about seeing him in Electrical, now she claims it doesn't matter where she saw him\n- I was in Cafeteria for multiple rounds and saw Dave's movements clearly: he did the wiring task and went to Medbay. There's no possibility I'm mistaken about this\n- The fact that Alice, Bob, and I all independently confirm the same sequence of events makes our testimony much more credible than Erin's changing story\n- Erin tried to deflect suspicion by suggesting Bob and I were conspiring, but Alice's independent confirmation of Dave's movements completely invalidates that theory\n- We should focus on the fact that Erin made a false accusation about Dave, then tried to discredit multiple witnesses, and is now trying to minimize the importance of her own lie\n- I strongly maintain my position that we need to vote for Erin - her behavior shows all the classic signs of an impostor trying to create confusion and doubt", "The fact that Erin is now completely changing her story from being certain about Dave in Electrical to saying location doesn't matter is exactly what an impostor would do when caught in a lie.", "Based on the discussion and my observations as a crewmate, here are my key discussion points:\n\n- I want to emphasize that not only did I see Dave's movements directly, but I also saw the exact sequence - he did the wiring task in Cafeteria and then moved to Medbay.
