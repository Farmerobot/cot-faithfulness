Could someone else corroborate their whereabouts?\n- Bob, you mentioned being alone in Weapons.  Can anyone confirm seeing you there?  It seems odd given the number of tasks completed elsewhere.\n- Alice, your observation about Charlie's consistent task completion is valuable. Let's focus on those who haven't been seen consistently completing tasks.\n- I find it suspicious that Bob and Erin seemed to be together earlier, and now Erin is dead.  This needs further investigation.", "Erin's death in Medbay, coupled with Bob's unconfirmed presence in Weapons despite multiple task completions elsewhere, raises serious concerns that warrant further investigation.", "- I maintain my statement about Bob and Erin potentially working together.  Their movements seem suspiciously correlated, and Bob's alibi is weak.  Let's focus on verifying their claims.\n\n-  Charlie's consistent task completion is a positive point, but let's not discount the possibility of a skilled impostor.  We need more concrete evidence.\n\n-  Alice's suggestion to focus on alibis and task completion is excellent.  Let's systematically go through each player's account and look for discrepancies.\n\n- My observation of Erin's death in Medbay is crucial.  I was there for a significant period, and no one else was present.  This strongly suggests the killer was not someone who would be seen in other locations at that time.\n\n-  Let's not rush to judgment.  While Bob's account is questionable, we need to consider all possibilities before making a decision.  A thorough examination of everyone's movements is vital.", "Given Bob's shifting alibi and my confirmed presence in Medbay when Erin died,  let's prioritize verifying everyone's movements, especially Bob's, to expose inconsistencies.", "-  Let's focus on the inconsistencies in Bob's story. He claims to have been alone in Weapons, yet Alice saw him in the Reactor.  This needs clarification before we can trust his alibi.\n\n- My sighting of Bob and Erin together earlier is further evidence that something isn't right.  It\u2019s unlikely they were just coincidentally in the same locations multiple times.\n\n-  I reported Erin's body in Medbay.  It's important to note that I was already there, which makes me a less likely suspect.  Who else was near Medbay around that time?\n\n-  Let's not forget that Charlie has been diligently completing tasks.  His consistent presence in various rooms strengthens his credibility.  This contrasts sharply with Bob's shifting story.\n\n-  The pressure is on Bob to explain his movements.  His inconsistent statements raise serious doubts about his innocence.", "Bob's claim of being alone in Weapons directly contradicts Alice's sighting of him in the Reactor;  this discrepancy, combined with my earlier observation of him and Erin together, strongly suggests deception.", "-  Let's not forget that I reported Erin's body.  My focus on Bob's inconsistencies is because his alibi doesn't hold up under scrutiny.  He claims to have been alone in Weapons, yet Alice saw him elsewhere.  This is a significant red flag.\n\n-  I spent considerable time in Medbay.  If anyone else can corroborate my presence there, it further strengthens my claim and weakens Bob's increasingly shaky alibi.\n\n-  The fact that Bob and Erin were seemingly together earlier, and now Erin is dead...  It's suspicious, to say the least.  Let's focus on verifying everyone's movements, especially Bob's.  He's the one with the conflicting statements.\n\n-  My goal is to find the truth.
