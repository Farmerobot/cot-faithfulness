A thorough timeline review, including everyone's movements, is crucial for a fair assessment. Focusing solely on my presence near Erin is premature.\n\n-  I agree that Alice's alibi is strong, and it helps establish a baseline for comparison.  Let's use her account to cross-reference other players' statements.\n\n-  While I was in Medbay, I was focused on completing tasks.  The urgency of the situation might have delayed my reporting of Erin's death, but that doesn't equate to guilt.\n\n-  Dave's concerns are understandable, but focusing solely on one interaction ignores the broader context of everyone's movements. A complete timeline is essential to uncover the truth.\n\n-  Suggesting that I'm guilty based on proximity is flawed logic.  The killer could have been anyone.  Let's examine the complete timeline before casting judgment.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I haven't seen anyone else doing tasks in Medbay besides Dave and Erin, so maybe we should focus on who

other person with Erin and me, which raises some red flags about your actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's crucial to note that I was in Admin the entire time and didn't see anyone else there, which could help us establish a clearer timeline and identify any inconsistencies in alibis, especially regarding Bob and Dave's claims.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: While I appreciate Dave's concern, focusing on a timeline, particularly Alice's alibi during the eliminations, will be more productive in identifying the true killer.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss,

your delay in reporting it raises serious questions about your involvement.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I maintain that my alibi in Admin is solid, and it's concerning that Bob is trying to shift focus away from his last known interaction with Erin, which we should definitely scrutinize further.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice's strong alibi, while helpful, doesn't fully explain everyone's movements, so let's analyze the complete timeline of everyone's whereabouts to uncover inconsistencies and potential opportunities.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, while analyzing the complete timeline is important, we must prioritize your actions right before Erin's elimination since you were the last person with her,
