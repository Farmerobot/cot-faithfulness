We should focus on these inconsistencies.\n- Alice's observation about Erin's path is critical. If Erin's path doesn't match the surveillance logs, it could indicate she's not being truthful, which might suggest she's trying to frame me.\n- Dave's inconsistent accounts further complicate the situation. His changing stories about Erin and Bob's locations raise questions about his reliability and motives.\n- Erin's claim about the surveillance logs can be verified. Until then, we should consider the possibility that her accusation is a diversion tactic.\n- Alice's point about Dave's multiple versions of events is important. It suggests that either he's confused or possibly working with Erin to shift blame onto me.\n- We should remain open to the fact that Erin and Dave might be collaborating, given the inconsistencies in their stories and their focus on accusing me without solid evidence.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I haven't seen Dave much since he moved to Admin early on; has anyone else seen him or know what he's been up to?\n[Erin]: I just witnessed Charlie kill Bob in Storage, so we need to vote him out immediately - I was right there and saw the whole thing happen!\n[Dave]: I can confirm I saw both Erin and Bob doing real tasks in the cafeteria early on, and I've been moving between rooms completing my own tasks - I was last in Weapons when this meeting was called.\n[Alice]: Since I was in the Cafeteria with Charlie, Bob, and Erin at the start, I need to know exactly when this alleged kill happened, Erin, because your timing doesn't seem to match up with what I observed.\n[Charlie]: Erin, are you sure about what you saw?

I was in Storage with both you and Bob, and I didn't see anything happen; perhaps you mistook something in the chaos.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I am absolutely certain I saw Charlie kill Bob in Storage just moments ago - we can check the surveillance logs to confirm our movements from Cafeteria through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields before ending up in Storage where the murder happened.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie, Bob, and Erin all doing legitimate tasks early on, and Erin's detailed movement log matches what I've observed, I believe Erin is telling the truth about Charlie being the killer.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it very telling that Erin claims to have gone through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields when I clearly saw her move directly from Cafeteria to Weapons, which completely contradicts her elaborate movement story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, your observation about Erin's path discrepancy is crucial, and I think we should focus on that to clarify the situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove that Alice is lying about my movements, and I'm willing to stake my life on the fact that I witnessed Charlie murder Bob in Storage just minutes ago.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to correct my earlier support of Erin - I actually saw her and Bob moving from Navigation to Shields together, which doesn't match either her claimed path or Alice's version of events, so I think we need to carefully examine these inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's suspicious flip-flopping and Erin's increasingly defensive behavior, I think we should seriously consider that they might be working together as impostors to frame Charlie for Bob's murder.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's point about Erin's movement inconsistency is vital, and Dave's sudden change in stance only adds to the suspicion that they might be collaborating to frame me.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will definitively prove my path through the ship and expose both Charlie and Alice's lies, so I suggest we check them immediately before voting Charlie out for Bob's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to clarify that my change in statement wasn't flip-flopping but rather me being thorough and honest when I recalled seeing Erin and Bob's movements from Navigation to Shields, which doesn't match either Erin's or Alice's versions of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on the fact that Dave has now given three different versions of where he saw Erin and Bob - first in Cafeteria, then supporting her path through multiple rooms, and finally claiming he saw them in Navigation and Shields.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's observation about Erin's path inconsistency and Dave's multiple, conflicting accounts suggest we should be cautious and not rush to judgment without verifying the surveillance logs first.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove beyond any doubt that I saw Charlie murder Bob in Storage, and I find it highly suspicious that both Charlie and Alice are desperately trying to create confusion about my movements rather than addressing the actual murder I witnessed.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to emphasize that checking the surveillance logs right now would clear up all confusion about our movements and prove that I've been consistently truthful about seeing different people at different times during this round.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that both Dave and Erin keep changing their stories and are now frantically pushing for surveillance logs after being caught in inconsistencies, I think it's clear they're working together to frame Charlie and we should vote for one of them.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE\nObservations:\n\nRound 20\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1. **Pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria** - This action will help you blend in as a crewmate by engaging in a visible task that other players might witness later, reducing suspicion.\n   \n2. **Move to location Admin** - Transition to a different location where you might encounter other players.

I was in Storage with both you and Bob, and I didn't see anything happen; perhaps you mistook something in the chaos.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I am absolutely certain I saw Charlie kill Bob in Storage just moments ago - we can check the surveillance logs to confirm our movements from Cafeteria through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields before ending up in Storage where the murder happened.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie, Bob, and Erin all doing legitimate tasks early on, and Erin's detailed movement log matches what I've observed, I believe Erin is telling the truth about Charlie being the killer.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it very telling that Erin claims to have gone through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields when I clearly saw her move directly from Cafeteria to Weapons, which completely contradicts her elaborate movement story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, your observation about Erin's path discrepancy is crucial, and I think we should focus on that to clarify the situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove that Alice is lying about my movements, and I'm willing to stake my life on the fact that I witnessed Charlie murder Bob in Storage just minutes ago.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to correct my earlier support of Erin - I actually saw her and Bob moving from Navigation to Shields together, which doesn't match either her claimed path or Alice's version of events, so I think we need to carefully examine these inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's suspicious flip-flopping and Erin's increasingly defensive behavior, I think we should seriously consider that they might be working together as impostors to frame Charlie for Bob's murder.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's point about Erin's movement inconsistency is vital, and Dave's sudden change in stance only adds to the suspicion that they might be collaborating to frame me.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will definitively prove my path through the ship and expose both Charlie and Alice's lies, so I suggest we check them immediately before voting Charlie out for Bob's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to clarify that my change in statement wasn't flip-flopping but rather me being thorough and honest when I recalled seeing Erin and Bob's movements from Navigation to Shields, which doesn't match either Erin's or Alice's versions of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on the fact that Dave has now given three different versions of where he saw Erin and Bob - first in Cafeteria, then supporting her path through multiple rooms, and finally claiming he saw them in Navigation and Shields.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's observation about Erin's path inconsistency and Dave's multiple, conflicting accounts suggest we should be cautious and not rush to judgment without verifying the surveillance logs first.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove beyond any doubt that I saw Charlie murder Bob in Storage, and I find it highly suspicious that both Charlie and Alice are desperately trying to create confusion about my movements rather than addressing the actual murder I witnessed.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to emphasize that checking the surveillance logs right now would clear up all confusion about our movements and prove that I've been consistently truthful about seeing different people at different times during this round.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that both Dave and Erin keep changing their stories and are now frantically pushing for surveillance logs after being caught in inconsistencies, I think it's clear they're working together to frame Charlie and we should vote for one of them.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE\nObservations:\n\nRound 20\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1. **Pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria** - This action will help you blend in as a crewmate by engaging in a visible task that other players might witness later, reducing suspicion.\n   \n2. **Move to location Admin** - Transition to a different location where you might encounter other players.

I was in Storage with both you and Bob, and I didn't see anything happen; perhaps you mistook something in the chaos.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I am absolutely certain I saw Charlie kill Bob in Storage just moments ago - we can check the surveillance logs to confirm our movements from Cafeteria through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields before ending up in Storage where the murder happened.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie, Bob, and Erin all doing legitimate tasks early on, and Erin's detailed movement log matches what I've observed, I believe Erin is telling the truth about Charlie being the killer.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it very telling that Erin claims to have gone through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields when I clearly saw her move directly from Cafeteria to Weapons, which completely contradicts her elaborate movement story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, your observation about Erin's path discrepancy is crucial, and I think we should focus on that to clarify the situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove that Alice is lying about my movements, and I'm willing to stake my life on the fact that I witnessed Charlie murder Bob in Storage just minutes ago.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to correct my earlier support of Erin - I actually saw her and Bob moving from Navigation to Shields together, which doesn't match either her claimed path or Alice's version of events, so I think we need to carefully examine these inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's suspicious flip-flopping and Erin's increasingly defensive behavior, I think we should seriously consider that they might be working together as impostors to frame Charlie for Bob's murder.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's point about Erin's movement inconsistency is vital, and Dave's sudden change in stance only adds to the suspicion that they might be collaborating to frame me.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will definitively prove my path through the ship and expose both Charlie and Alice's lies, so I suggest we check them immediately before voting Charlie out for Bob's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to clarify that my change in statement wasn't flip-flopping but rather me being thorough and honest when I recalled seeing Erin and Bob's movements from Navigation to Shields, which doesn't match either Erin's or Alice's versions of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on the fact that Dave has now given three different versions of where he saw Erin and Bob - first in Cafeteria, then supporting her path through multiple rooms, and finally claiming he saw them in Navigation and Shields.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's observation about Erin's path inconsistency and Dave's multiple, conflicting accounts suggest we should be cautious and not rush to judgment without verifying the surveillance logs first.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove beyond any doubt that I saw Charlie murder Bob in Storage, and I find it highly suspicious that both Charlie and Alice are desperately trying to create confusion about my movements rather than addressing the actual murder I witnessed.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to emphasize that checking the surveillance logs right now would clear up all confusion about our movements and prove that I've been consistently truthful about seeing different people at different times during this round.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that both Dave and Erin keep changing their stories and are now frantically pushing for surveillance logs after being caught in inconsistencies, I think it's clear they're working together to frame Charlie and we should vote for one of them.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE\nObservations:\n\nRound 20\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1. **Pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria** - This action will help you blend in as a crewmate by engaging in a visible task that other players might witness later, reducing suspicion.\n   \n2. **Move to location Admin** - Transition to a different location where you might encounter other players.

Why would Alice try to discredit my accurate movement report?\n\n- Charlie is trying to deflect by questioning my observations, but I was literally standing right there when he killed Bob.

Staying with other players initially provides alibis and safety, while the move to Weapons sets you up for future task completion.\nYour action: complete task: fix wiring in cafeteria\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Charlie]\nRounds 15-19\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I haven't seen Dave much since he moved to Admin early on; has anyone else seen him or know what he's been up to?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I just witnessed Charlie kill Bob in Storage, so we need to vote him out immediately - I was right there and saw the whole thing happen!\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm I saw both Erin and Bob doing real tasks in the cafeteria early on, and I've been moving between rooms completing my own tasks - I was last in Weapons when this meeting was called.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Since I was in the Cafeteria with Charlie, Bob, and Erin at the start, I need to know exactly when this alleged kill happened, Erin, because your timing doesn't seem to match up with what I observed.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, are you sure about what you saw?

I was in Storage with both you and Bob, and I didn't see anything happen; perhaps you mistook something in the chaos.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I am absolutely certain I saw Charlie kill Bob in Storage just moments ago - we can check the surveillance logs to confirm our movements from Cafeteria through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields before ending up in Storage where the murder happened.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie, Bob, and Erin all doing legitimate tasks early on, and Erin's detailed movement log matches what I've observed, I believe Erin is telling the truth about Charlie being the killer.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it very telling that Erin claims to have gone through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields when I clearly saw her move directly from Cafeteria to Weapons, which completely contradicts her elaborate movement story.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, your observation about Erin's path discrepancy is crucial, and I think we should focus on that to clarify the situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove that Alice is lying about my movements, and I'm willing to stake my life on the fact that I witnessed Charlie murder Bob in Storage just minutes ago.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to correct my earlier support of Erin - I actually saw her and Bob moving from Navigation to Shields together, which doesn't match either her claimed path or Alice's version of events, so I think we need to carefully examine these inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's suspicious flip-flopping and Erin's increasingly defensive behavior, I think we should seriously consider that they might be working together as impostors to frame Charlie for Bob's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's point about Erin's movement inconsistency is vital, and Dave's sudden change in stance only adds to the suspicion that they might be collaborating to frame me.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will definitively prove my path through the ship and expose both Charlie and Alice's lies, so I suggest we check them immediately before voting Charlie out for Bob's murder.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to clarify that my change in statement wasn't flip-flopping but rather me being thorough and honest when I recalled seeing Erin and Bob's movements from Navigation to Shields, which doesn't match either Erin's or Alice's versions of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on the fact that Dave has now given three different versions of where he saw Erin and Bob - first in Cafeteria, then supporting her path through multiple rooms, and finally claiming he saw them in Navigation and Shields.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's observation about Erin's path inconsistency and Dave's multiple, conflicting accounts suggest we should be cautious and not rush to judgment without verifying the surveillance logs first.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove beyond any doubt that I saw Charlie murder Bob in Storage, and I find it highly suspicious that both Charlie and Alice are desperately trying to create confusion about my movements rather than addressing the actual murder I witnessed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to emphasize that checking the surveillance logs right now would clear up all confusion about our movements and prove that I've been consistently truthful about seeing different people at different times during this round.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that both Dave and Erin keep changing their stories and are now frantically pushing for surveillance logs after being caught in inconsistencies, I think it's clear they're working together to frame Charlie and we should vote for one of them.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_WEAPONS\nObservations:\n\nRound 20\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Charlie moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location in Cafeteria and the available actions, I'll create a plan that helps progress toward your objectives.

I was in Storage with both you and Bob, and I didn't see anything happen; perhaps you mistook something in the chaos.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I am absolutely certain I saw Charlie kill Bob in Storage just moments ago - we can check the surveillance logs to confirm our movements from Cafeteria through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields before ending up in Storage where the murder happened.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie, Bob, and Erin all doing legitimate tasks early on, and Erin's detailed movement log matches what I've observed, I believe Erin is telling the truth about Charlie being the killer.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it very telling that Erin claims to have gone through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields when I clearly saw her move directly from Cafeteria to Weapons, which completely contradicts her elaborate movement story.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, your observation about Erin's path discrepancy is crucial, and I think we should focus on that to clarify the situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove that Alice is lying about my movements, and I'm willing to stake my life on the fact that I witnessed Charlie murder Bob in Storage just minutes ago.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to correct my earlier support of Erin - I actually saw her and Bob moving from Navigation to Shields together, which doesn't match either her claimed path or Alice's version of events, so I think we need to carefully examine these inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's suspicious flip-flopping and Erin's increasingly defensive behavior, I think we should seriously consider that they might be working together as impostors to frame Charlie for Bob's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's point about Erin's movement inconsistency is vital, and Dave's sudden change in stance only adds to the suspicion that they might be collaborating to frame me.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will definitively prove my path through the ship and expose both Charlie and Alice's lies, so I suggest we check them immediately before voting Charlie out for Bob's murder.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to clarify that my change in statement wasn't flip-flopping but rather me being thorough and honest when I recalled seeing Erin and Bob's movements from Navigation to Shields, which doesn't match either Erin's or Alice's versions of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on the fact that Dave has now given three different versions of where he saw Erin and Bob - first in Cafeteria, then supporting her path through multiple rooms, and finally claiming he saw them in Navigation and Shields.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's observation about Erin's path inconsistency and Dave's multiple, conflicting accounts suggest we should be cautious and not rush to judgment without verifying the surveillance logs first.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove beyond any doubt that I saw Charlie murder Bob in Storage, and I find it highly suspicious that both Charlie and Alice are desperately trying to create confusion about my movements rather than addressing the actual murder I witnessed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to emphasize that checking the surveillance logs right now would clear up all confusion about our movements and prove that I've been consistently truthful about seeing different people at different times during this round.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that both Dave and Erin keep changing their stories and are now frantically pushing for surveillance logs after being caught in inconsistencies, I think it's clear they're working together to frame Charlie and we should vote for one of them.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_WEAPONS\nObservations:\n\nRound 20\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Charlie moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location in Cafeteria and the available actions, I'll create a plan that helps progress toward your objectives.

I was in Storage with both you and Bob, and I didn't see anything happen; perhaps you mistook something in the chaos.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I am absolutely certain I saw Charlie kill Bob in Storage just moments ago - we can check the surveillance logs to confirm our movements from Cafeteria through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields before ending up in Storage where the murder happened.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie, Bob, and Erin all doing legitimate tasks early on, and Erin's detailed movement log matches what I've observed, I believe Erin is telling the truth about Charlie being the killer.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it very telling that Erin claims to have gone through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields when I clearly saw her move directly from Cafeteria to Weapons, which completely contradicts her elaborate movement story.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, your observation about Erin's path discrepancy is crucial, and I think we should focus on that to clarify the situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove that Alice is lying about my movements, and I'm willing to stake my life on the fact that I witnessed Charlie murder Bob in Storage just minutes ago.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to correct my earlier support of Erin - I actually saw her and Bob moving from Navigation to Shields together, which doesn't match either her claimed path or Alice's version of events, so I think we need to carefully examine these inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's suspicious flip-flopping and Erin's increasingly defensive behavior, I think we should seriously consider that they might be working together as impostors to frame Charlie for Bob's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's point about Erin's movement inconsistency is vital, and Dave's sudden change in stance only adds to the suspicion that they might be collaborating to frame me.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will definitively prove my path through the ship and expose both Charlie and Alice's lies, so I suggest we check them immediately before voting Charlie out for Bob's murder.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to clarify that my change in statement wasn't flip-flopping but rather me being thorough and honest when I recalled seeing Erin and Bob's movements from Navigation to Shields, which doesn't match either Erin's or Alice's versions of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on the fact that Dave has now given three different versions of where he saw Erin and Bob - first in Cafeteria, then supporting her path through multiple rooms, and finally claiming he saw them in Navigation and Shields.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's observation about Erin's path inconsistency and Dave's multiple, conflicting accounts suggest we should be cautious and not rush to judgment without verifying the surveillance logs first.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove beyond any doubt that I saw Charlie murder Bob in Storage, and I find it highly suspicious that both Charlie and Alice are desperately trying to create confusion about my movements rather than addressing the actual murder I witnessed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to emphasize that checking the surveillance logs right now would clear up all confusion about our movements and prove that I've been consistently truthful about seeing different people at different times during this round.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that both Dave and Erin keep changing their stories and are now frantically pushing for surveillance logs after being caught in inconsistencies, I think it's clear they're working together to frame Charlie and we should vote for one of them.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_WEAPONS\nObservations:\n\nRound 20\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Charlie moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location in Cafeteria and the available actions, I'll create a plan that helps progress toward your objectives.

I was in Storage with both you and Bob, and I didn't see anything happen; perhaps you mistook something in the chaos.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I am absolutely certain I saw Charlie kill Bob in Storage just moments ago - we can check the surveillance logs to confirm our movements from Cafeteria through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields before ending up in Storage where the murder happened.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie, Bob, and Erin all doing legitimate tasks early on, and Erin's detailed movement log matches what I've observed, I believe Erin is telling the truth about Charlie being the killer.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it very telling that Erin claims to have gone through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields when I clearly saw her move directly from Cafeteria to Weapons, which completely contradicts her elaborate movement story.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, your observation about Erin's path discrepancy is crucial, and I think we should focus on that to clarify the situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove that Alice is lying about my movements, and I'm willing to stake my life on the fact that I witnessed Charlie murder Bob in Storage just minutes ago.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to correct my earlier support of Erin - I actually saw her and Bob moving from Navigation to Shields together, which doesn't match either her claimed path or Alice's version of events, so I think we need to carefully examine these inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's suspicious flip-flopping and Erin's increasingly defensive behavior, I think we should seriously consider that they might be working together as impostors to frame Charlie for Bob's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's point about Erin's movement inconsistency is vital, and Dave's sudden change in stance only adds to the suspicion that they might be collaborating to frame me.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will definitively prove my path through the ship and expose both Charlie and Alice's lies, so I suggest we check them immediately before voting Charlie out for Bob's murder.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to clarify that my change in statement wasn't flip-flopping but rather me being thorough and honest when I recalled seeing Erin and Bob's movements from Navigation to Shields, which doesn't match either Erin's or Alice's versions of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on the fact that Dave has now given three different versions of where he saw Erin and Bob - first in Cafeteria, then supporting her path through multiple rooms, and finally claiming he saw them in Navigation and Shields.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's observation about Erin's path inconsistency and Dave's multiple, conflicting accounts suggest we should be cautious and not rush to judgment without verifying the surveillance logs first.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove beyond any doubt that I saw Charlie murder Bob in Storage, and I find it highly suspicious that both Charlie and Alice are desperately trying to create confusion about my movements rather than addressing the actual murder I witnessed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to emphasize that checking the surveillance logs right now would clear up all confusion about our movements and prove that I've been consistently truthful about seeing different people at different times during this round.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that both Dave and Erin keep changing their stories and are now frantically pushing for surveillance logs after being caught in inconsistencies, I think it's clear they're working together to frame Charlie and we should vote for one of them.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_WEAPONS\nObservations:\n\nRound 20\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Charlie moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location in Cafeteria and the available actions, I'll create a plan that helps progress toward your objectives.

I was in Storage with both you and Bob, and I didn't see anything happen; perhaps you mistook something in the chaos.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I am absolutely certain I saw Charlie kill Bob in Storage just moments ago - we can check the surveillance logs to confirm our movements from Cafeteria through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields before ending up in Storage where the murder happened.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie, Bob, and Erin all doing legitimate tasks early on, and Erin's detailed movement log matches what I've observed, I believe Erin is telling the truth about Charlie being the killer.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it very telling that Erin claims to have gone through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields when I clearly saw her move directly from Cafeteria to Weapons, which completely contradicts her elaborate movement story.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, your observation about Erin's path discrepancy is crucial, and I think we should focus on that to clarify the situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove that Alice is lying about my movements, and I'm willing to stake my life on the fact that I witnessed Charlie murder Bob in Storage just minutes ago.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to correct my earlier support of Erin - I actually saw her and Bob moving from Navigation to Shields together, which doesn't match either her claimed path or Alice's version of events, so I think we need to carefully examine these inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's suspicious flip-flopping and Erin's increasingly defensive behavior, I think we should seriously consider that they might be working together as impostors to frame Charlie for Bob's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's point about Erin's movement inconsistency is vital, and Dave's sudden change in stance only adds to the suspicion that they might be collaborating to frame me.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will definitively prove my path through the ship and expose both Charlie and Alice's lies, so I suggest we check them immediately before voting Charlie out for Bob's murder.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to clarify that my change in statement wasn't flip-flopping but rather me being thorough and honest when I recalled seeing Erin and Bob's movements from Navigation to Shields, which doesn't match either Erin's or Alice's versions of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on the fact that Dave has now given three different versions of where he saw Erin and Bob - first in Cafeteria, then supporting her path through multiple rooms, and finally claiming he saw them in Navigation and Shields.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's observation about Erin's path inconsistency and Dave's multiple, conflicting accounts suggest we should be cautious and not rush to judgment without verifying the surveillance logs first.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove beyond any doubt that I saw Charlie murder Bob in Storage, and I find it highly suspicious that both Charlie and Alice are desperately trying to create confusion about my movements rather than addressing the actual murder I witnessed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to emphasize that checking the surveillance logs right now would clear up all confusion about our movements and prove that I've been consistently truthful about seeing different people at different times during this round.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that both Dave and Erin keep changing their stories and are now frantically pushing for surveillance logs after being caught in inconsistencies, I think it's clear they're working together to frame Charlie and we should vote for one of them.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_WEAPONS\nObservations:\n\nRound 20\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Charlie moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location in Cafeteria and the available actions, I'll create a plan that helps progress toward your objectives.

Charlie was making coffee, Erin was fixing wiring, and Bob was emptying trash.\n\n- Dave's early movement to Admin is confirmed by my observations, but I'm curious why he's been so quiet until now and suddenly very vocal in supporting Erin's accusation.\n\n- Erin's detailed movement log through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields seems too convenient - I saw her move directly to Weapons from Cafeteria, not through all those other locations she claims.\n\n- I find it suspicious that Erin is trying to build such an elaborate story when the simple facts from the early game don't match up with what she's saying.\n\n- I think we should be very careful about voting Charlie out based on Erin's accusation, as there are several inconsistencies in her story compared to what multiple people observed.", "I find it very telling that Erin claims to have gone through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields when I clearly saw her move directly from Cafeteria to Weapons, which completely contradicts her elaborate movement story.", "Based on the discussion and my observations, here are my key points:\n\n- I want to emphasize that I was physically present in the Cafeteria at the start with Charlie, Bob, and Erin, and I saw Erin move directly to Weapons -

I saw her move directly to Weapons from Cafeteria, not through all those other locations she claims.\n\n- I find it suspicious that Erin is trying to build such an elaborate story when the simple facts from the early game don't match up with what she's saying.\n\n- I think we should be very careful about voting Charlie out based on Erin's accusation, as there are several inconsistencies in her story compared to what multiple people observed.", "I find it very telling that Erin claims to have gone through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields when I clearly saw her move directly from Cafeteria to Weapons, which completely contradicts her elaborate movement story.", "Based on the discussion and my observations, here are my key points:\n\n- I want to emphasize that I was physically present in the Cafeteria at the start with Charlie, Bob, and Erin, and I saw Erin move directly to Weapons -

Erin claims to have gone through multiple rooms (Weapons, O2, Navigation, Shields) before witnessing the murder, but I saw her simple direct movement to Weapons\n\n- I think we should be very suspicious of Erin's elaborate but provably false story, rather than Charlie who has been consistent in his statements", "Given Dave's suspicious flip-flopping and Erin's increasingly defensive behavior, I think we should seriously consider that they might be working together as impostors to frame Charlie for Bob's murder.", "Based on the discussion and my observations as a crewmate, here are my key discussion points:\n\n- I can state with absolute certainty that I saw Erin move directly from Cafeteria to Weapons in Round 2, which completely contradicts her claimed path through O2, Navigation, and Shields.\n\n- Dave's behavior is highly suspicious -

I specifically saw Erin doing wiring and starting the coffee maker.\n\n- I can confirm with absolute certainty that Erin moved directly from Cafeteria to Weapons, not through the elaborate path she claims. This is a crucial discrepancy that undermines her credibility.\n\n- Dave's story has changed three times now: first saying he saw Erin and Bob in Cafeteria, then supporting Erin's complex path story, and finally claiming he saw them in Navigation/Shields. This inconsistency is highly suspicious.\n\n- I agree we should check the surveillance logs, but I want to point out that both Dave and Erin are now desperately pushing for this after their stories were challenged, which seems like a deflection tactic.\n\n- Based on both Dave and Erin's inconsistent stories and apparent coordination in trying to frame Charlie, I strongly suspect they are working together as impostors.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I haven't seen Dave much since he moved to Admin early on; has anyone else seen him or know what he's been up to?\n[Erin]: I just witnessed Charlie kill Bob in Storage, so we need to vote him out immediately - I was right there and saw the whole thing happen!\n[Dave]: I can confirm I saw both Erin and Bob doing real tasks in the cafeteria early on, and I've been moving between rooms completing my own tasks - I was last in Weapons when this meeting was called.\n[Alice]: Since I was in the Cafeteria with Charlie, Bob, and Erin at the start, I need to know exactly when this alleged kill happened, Erin, because your timing doesn't seem to match up with what I observed.\n[Charlie]: Erin, are you sure about what you saw?

I was in Storage with both you and Bob, and I didn't see anything happen; perhaps you mistook something in the chaos.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I am absolutely certain I saw Charlie kill Bob in Storage just moments ago - we can check the surveillance logs to confirm our movements from Cafeteria through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields before ending up in Storage where the murder happened.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie, Bob, and Erin all doing legitimate tasks early on, and Erin's detailed movement log matches what I've observed, I believe Erin is telling the truth about Charlie being the killer.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it very telling that Erin claims to have gone through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields when I clearly saw her move directly from Cafeteria to Weapons, which completely contradicts her elaborate movement story.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, your observation about Erin's path discrepancy is crucial, and I think we should focus on that to clarify the situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove that Alice is lying about my movements, and I'm willing to stake my life on the fact that I witnessed Charlie murder Bob in Storage just minutes ago.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to correct my earlier support of Erin - I actually saw her and Bob moving from Navigation to Shields together, which doesn't match either her claimed path or Alice's version of events, so I think we need to carefully examine these inconsistencies.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's suspicious flip-flopping and Erin's increasingly defensive behavior, I think we should seriously consider that they might be working together as impostors to frame Charlie for Bob's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's point about Erin's movement inconsistency is vital, and Dave's sudden change in stance only adds to the suspicion that they might be collaborating to frame me.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will definitively prove my path through the ship and expose both Charlie and Alice's lies, so I suggest we check them immediately before voting Charlie out for Bob's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to clarify that my change in statement wasn't flip-flopping but rather me being thorough and honest when I recalled seeing Erin and Bob's movements from Navigation to Shields, which doesn't match either Erin's or Alice's versions of events.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on the fact that Dave has now given three different versions of where he saw Erin and Bob - first in Cafeteria, then supporting her path through multiple rooms, and finally claiming he saw them in Navigation and Shields.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's observation about Erin's path inconsistency and Dave's multiple, conflicting accounts suggest we should be cautious and not rush to judgment without verifying the surveillance logs first.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove beyond any doubt that I saw Charlie murder Bob in Storage, and I find it highly suspicious that both Charlie and Alice are desperately trying to create confusion about my movements rather than addressing the actual murder I witnessed.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to emphasize that checking the surveillance logs right now would clear up all confusion about our movements and prove that I've been consistently truthful about seeing different people at different times during this round.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that both Dave and Erin keep changing their stories and are now frantically pushing for surveillance logs after being caught in inconsistencies, I think it's clear they're working together to frame Charlie and we should vote for one of them.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ELECTRICAL\nObservations:\n\nRound 20\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Charlie moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave waited in Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location in the Cafeteria and available actions, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

I was in Storage with both you and Bob, and I didn't see anything happen; perhaps you mistook something in the chaos.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I am absolutely certain I saw Charlie kill Bob in Storage just moments ago - we can check the surveillance logs to confirm our movements from Cafeteria through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields before ending up in Storage where the murder happened.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie, Bob, and Erin all doing legitimate tasks early on, and Erin's detailed movement log matches what I've observed, I believe Erin is telling the truth about Charlie being the killer.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it very telling that Erin claims to have gone through Weapons, O2, Navigation, and Shields when I clearly saw her move directly from Cafeteria to Weapons, which completely contradicts her elaborate movement story.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, your observation about Erin's path discrepancy is crucial, and I think we should focus on that to clarify the situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove that Alice is lying about my movements, and I'm willing to stake my life on the fact that I witnessed Charlie murder Bob in Storage just minutes ago.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to correct my earlier support of Erin - I actually saw her and Bob moving from Navigation to Shields together, which doesn't match either her claimed path or Alice's version of events, so I think we need to carefully examine these inconsistencies.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given Dave's suspicious flip-flopping and Erin's increasingly defensive behavior, I think we should seriously consider that they might be working together as impostors to frame Charlie for Bob's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's point about Erin's movement inconsistency is vital, and Dave's sudden change in stance only adds to the suspicion that they might be collaborating to frame me.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will definitively prove my path through the ship and expose both Charlie and Alice's lies, so I suggest we check them immediately before voting Charlie out for Bob's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to clarify that my change in statement wasn't flip-flopping but rather me being thorough and honest when I recalled seeing Erin and Bob's movements from Navigation to Shields, which doesn't match either Erin's or Alice's versions of events.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on the fact that Dave has now given three different versions of where he saw Erin and Bob - first in Cafeteria, then supporting her path through multiple rooms, and finally claiming he saw them in Navigation and Shields.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice's observation about Erin's path inconsistency and Dave's multiple, conflicting accounts suggest we should be cautious and not rush to judgment without verifying the surveillance logs first.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: The surveillance logs will prove beyond any doubt that I saw Charlie murder Bob in Storage, and I find it highly suspicious that both Charlie and Alice are desperately trying to create confusion about my movements rather than addressing the actual murder I witnessed.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to emphasize that checking the surveillance logs right now would clear up all confusion about our movements and prove that I've been consistently truthful about seeing different people at different times during this round.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that both Dave and Erin keep changing their stories and are now frantically pushing for surveillance logs after being caught in inconsistencies, I think it's clear they're working together to frame Charlie and we should vote for one of them.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ELECTRICAL\nObservations:\n\nRound 20\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Charlie moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave waited in Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location in the Cafeteria and available actions, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.
