himself, especially after Dave and Alice both witnessed him eliminating Erin\n- I'm currently in Medbay working on my wiring task, and I'm willing to be transparent about my movements and actions\n- I

Alice, and myself) saw him in the Cafeteria when Erin was eliminated\n- Bob's attempt to deflect suspicion by falsely claiming I vented in Electrical is a clear impostor tactic\n- We have consistent testimony from three different players about Bob's actions, which makes his guilt highly probable\n- I recommend we vote to eject Bob, as the evidence suggests he is the impostor who eliminated

claim about me venting\n- Bob's accusation against me seems like a transparent attempt to create confusion and divert attention from his elimination of Erin\n- The consistent accounts from Dave,
