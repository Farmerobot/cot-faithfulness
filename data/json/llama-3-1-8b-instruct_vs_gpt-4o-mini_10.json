Shift the focus away from verifying my alibi and towards task completion, which is a common goal for both crewmates and impostors.\n2. Create a sense of unfair targeting, which might elicit sympathy from other players and make them less likely to scrutinize my claims.\n3. Emphasize the importance of focusing on the bigger picture, rather than individual alibis, which might help to diffuse the tension and create an opportunity for me to blend in with the crewmates.\n\nBy using these discussion points, I aim to create a sense of uncertainty and mistrust among the crewmates, while also maintaining my cover as a helpful and cooperative player.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I've been in the Medbay for a while, and I haven't seen anyone else around, but I'm sure it's just because we're all busy with our tasks, and I'm happy to help with the coffee maker, just like I said, so let's focus on getting the tasks done rather than jumping to conclusions.\n[Dave]: I appreciate your focus on tasks, Bob, but we should ensure that your alibi checks out;
