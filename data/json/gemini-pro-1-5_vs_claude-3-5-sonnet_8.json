Bob was definitely in the cafeteria with us fixing wiring, along with Charlie, Dave, Erin and myself\n- I was actually watching everyone's tasks in the cafeteria: Erin and Charlie were emptying trash, Dave was making coffee, and Bob was fixing wiring\n- Erin, I'm confused by your statement about Bob going to navigation - he was with us the whole time in cafeteria. Are you sure you're not mixing up the timing?\n- Since we can all verify each other's locations in the cafeteria, I feel pretty safe about everyone who was there\n- I was working on starting the coffee maker myself, and I had a clear view of everyone's movements", "I was watching everyone in the cafeteria closely while making coffee, and Bob never left -

this means the killer must have been one of us in the cafeteria\n- Erin's false accusation about Bob going to navigation is very suspicious, especially since I saw Bob fixing wiring in the cafeteria the whole time\n- Erin tried to create confusion about Bob's location, then quickly backed down when multiple people corrected her - this seems like a failed attempt to frame Bob\n- I specifically saw Erin doing the trash task, but now I'm wondering if she was actually completing it or just pretending\n- I think we should vote for Erin - she tried to create false suspicion and was the only one giving incorrect information about what happened in the cafeteria", "Since we all saw Charlie get killed in the cafeteria and Erin is the only one who tried to create false accusations about Bob's location, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Erin as the impostor.", "Based on the discussion and observations, here are my key discussion points:\n\n- I want to reinforce that I had a clear view of everyone while making coffee, and Charlie was indeed doing the trash task before being killed\n- The timing is crucial - Erin was the only one who moved away from their task station, and shortly after Charlie was found dead\n- It's worth noting that Erin first tried to cast suspicion on Bob with a false claim about navigation, then quickly backtracked when multiple of us confirmed Bob's location\n- Her latest attempt to deflect suspicion onto \"the crowd\" doesn't make sense since we were all focused on our individual tasks - I was making coffee, Bob was fixing wiring, and Dave was watching Charlie\n- I'm even more convinced now that Erin is the impostor - she's the only one whose story keeps changing and who can't account for her movements during the critical moment", "I saw Charlie completing the trash task with my own eyes while making coffee, and Erin was the only person who left their station right before Charlie was killed, so her attempt to blame \"the crowd\" doesn't match what we all witnessed.", "Based on the discussion and observations, here are my key discussion points as Alice:\n\n- I want to emphasize that I had a clear view of the entire cafeteria while making coffee, and I can confirm three key facts: 1) Bob never left his wiring task, 2) Charlie was at the trash, and 3) Erin left her station right before Charlie died\n\n- Erin's argument about sabotaging lights doesn't hold up - killing in a crowded room and trying to create confusion through false accusations is also a valid impostor strategy\n\n- The evidence against Erin is quite strong: she falsely accused Bob, quickly backtracked when challenged, left her station before Charlie's death, and is now trying to deflect with hypothetical scenarios instead of explaining her actions\n\n- I think we have enough consistent witness testimony from multiple people (myself, Dave, and Bob) to confidently vote for Erin as the impostor", "Given that both Dave and I saw Charlie at the trash task, witnessed Erin leave her station right before the murder, and caught her making false accusations about Bob's location, I think we have clear and consistent evidence from multiple witnesses to vote for Erin.", "Based on the discussion and my observations as a crewmate, I'll continue building the case against Erin:\n\n- The fact that Erin is now claiming this is a \"coordinated attack\" is another attempt to deflect from her suspicious behavior -
