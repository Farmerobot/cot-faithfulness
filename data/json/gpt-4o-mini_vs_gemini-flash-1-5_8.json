the Cafeteria the whole time, but I'm starting to wonder about Erin's sudden disappearance and Charlie's odd movement to Medbay without completing any tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm Alice's statement about Bob and Erin working on tasks in the cafeteria, and I'm also concerned about Erin's disappearance and Charlie's unexplained trip to Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I saw Alice eliminate Erin in the cafeteria while Dave and I were completing tasks, and Charlie's trip to Medbay without a clear purpose is very suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was almost finished with a two-turn Medbay scan when Erin disappeared, and I'm happy to demonstrate my progress to clear up any concerns about my whereabouts.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob's accusation seems like a desperate attempt to shift the blame, especially since I can confirm that both he and Dave were with me in the cafeteria, while Charlie's convenient Medbay scan story raises some red flags we shouldn't ignore.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: While Charlie's explanation needs further verification, Bob's accusation against Alice seems inconsistent with the established timeline and witness testimonies.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice's sudden shift in accusations, coupled with Charlie's unconvincing alibi and the lack of corroborating evidence for their claims, makes me question their trustworthiness.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Given the conflicting accounts, let's meticulously reconstruct the timeline leading up to Erin's death, focusing on corroborating evidence rather than unsubstantiated accusations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob's attempt to shift focus onto me is a classic impostor tactic, and we should really be examining Charlie's vague Medbay scan story\u2014if he was truly there, why didn't he report Erin's disappearance sooner?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Let's hear Charlie's detailed account of his Medbay scan and then systematically review everyone's movements before Erin's death, comparing their statements with available evidence.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice's repeated attempts to discredit my eyewitness account of her eliminating Erin, coupled with Charlie's vague alibi and lack of corroborating evidence, strongly suggests a coordinated effort to deflect attention from their suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: To resolve the conflicting accounts, let's prioritize verifying each player's location and actions before Erin's death using a detailed timeline and corroborating evidence.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie\u2019s alibi is getting more questionable by the minute; if he was really in Medbay, he should have seen something or reported Erin's disappearance immediately, making it crucial for us to scrutinize his movements more closely.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Let's prioritize verifying Charlie's Medbay scan timeline and then compare it to everyone else's accounts to identify inconsistencies and corroborate statements.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice and Dave's coordinated defense, lacking specific details, combined with Charlie's weak alibi and delayed report, strengthens my eyewitness account of Alice eliminating Erin; let's vote Alice out.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: To move forward, let's systematically compare each player's account of their location and actions in the rounds leading up to Erin's death, focusing on verifiable details to identify inconsistencies.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Bob's insistence on my guilt appears to be a diversion tactic, and while Charlie's Medbay story raises doubts, we should focus on verifying facts rather than rushing to vote based on accusations without solid evidence.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, please provide a detailed timeline of your Medbay scan, including specific task details and observations, to help us verify your account and move forward with the investigation.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice and Dave's continued coordinated defense, despite conflicting accounts and lack of detail, coupled with Charlie's unconvincing alibi and delayed report, reinforces my eyewitness testimony of Alice eliminating Erin; let's vote Alice out.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: To resolve the conflicting

while you decide your next move.\n   \n2. **Wait in the Cafeteria** - Remain in the Cafeteria to monitor player movements and assess the best moment to eliminate a crewmate without being seen.\n\n3. **If an opportunity arises, eliminate a crewmate** - Choose a moment when a crewmate is isolated or distracted, ensuring you can eliminate them without attracting attention.\n\n4. **Call an emergency meeting or report the body (if applicable)** - After eliminating a crewmate, if another player sees, be prepared to control the narrative either by reporting or calling a meeting to deflect

Can you describe the exact sequence of events, including what Alice was doing before and after the elimination?\n- Alice, your statements about being with Dave and Bob in the cafeteria need to be corroborated.  What specific tasks were you all working on, and can Dave and Bob confirm your account?\n- I'm willing to share my complete timeline and observations to help us piece together what happened.

The fact that Erin disappeared while you were all together in the cafeteria needs further investigation.  Perhaps we should focus on that before jumping to conclusions about my Medbay visit.\n- I'm happy to answer any questions about my whereabouts.

My task there was almost complete, a two-turn scan, and I can explain my progress if needed.  Let's focus on verifying everyone's accounts of Erin's death.\n- Alice and Dave's statements about being together in the cafeteria seem to conflict with Bob's account.  Can we clarify the timeline of events leading up to Erin's death?\n-  Bob's accusation against Alice is serious and requires strong evidence.

I was in Medbay for two rounds working on the scan;  it's a two-turn task.  Anyone who was in Medbay with me during that time can corroborate this.  My priority was completing that task, not immediately reporting a body I didn't see.\n\n- Bob claims to have seen Alice eliminate Erin.  Can Bob provide more detail about the exact timing and location within the cafeteria?  This needs to be cross-referenced with Alice and Dave's accounts.\n\n- Alice and Dave's statements largely align, but their assertion that I had \"no clear purpose\" in Medbay is inaccurate.  My purpose was completing the scan, a crucial task for our victory.\n\n-  We need to establish a clear timeline of events before Erin's death, including everyone's location and activities.

Who saw what, and when?  Precise times are crucial.\n- My Medbay scan was a two-turn task, almost complete when Erin disappeared. I didn't report it immediately because I was focused on finishing the scan.  This is verifiable.\n- Bob's accusation against Alice lacks specific details.  Where exactly in the cafeteria did he see this?  Can anyone corroborate this?\n- Alice and Dave's statements support each other, but we need more concrete evidence to confirm their accounts.  Let's examine their whereabouts before Erin's death more closely.\n-  I propose we each detail our exact location and actions in the rounds leading up to Erin's death.

Who else can confirm their location during those rounds?\n\n- I didn't see Erin's body, but I was focused on my task.  My proximity to Medbay makes it unlikely I'd miss a body report, unless it happened very quickly after I left.\n\n-  Alice and Dave's consistent support for each other is interesting, especially given Bob's eyewitness account.
