it's time for us to take a unified stance and consider voting Bob off the ship.\n- Bob's continued attempts to shift suspicion away from himself only serve to further demonstrate his lack of credibility and raise more suspicions about his intentions;

I firmly believe that voting him off the ship is the best course of action to protect the remaining crewmates and ensure our chances of completing the tasks.\n- I'd like to ask the other players if they have any information or observations that could help us confirm or deny Bob's claims about his actions in Medbay; it's crucial that we make an informed decision about who to vote off the ship.\n- Given the evidence and Bob's suspicious behavior, I think it's time for us to make a decision; I propose that we vote Bob off the ship to protect the remaining crewmates and ensure our chances of completing the tasks.", "I'd like to address Bob's attempt to divert attention from his actions in Medbay by bringing up other locations like Admin or Electrical;
