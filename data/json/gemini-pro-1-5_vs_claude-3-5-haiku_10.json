helps our team's progress, but I'm worried about Dave's suspicious activity in Electrical that Charlie mentioned.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'm concerned about Dave's prolonged time in Electrical, and I think we should carefully question his movements and task completion status to ensure the safety of our crew.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was not in Electrical at any point, and I can confidently trace my movements through Cafeteria, Admin, and Storage while completing tasks like wiring, so these claims about me being in Electrical are completely false and seem like an attempt to create unnecessary suspicion about my actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It's strange that both Erin and Bob also seem to think Dave was in Electrical; are you sure you weren't mistaken,

Maintain my innocence\n2. Highlight the lack of specific evidence\n3. Suggest their accusations are coordinated and potentially malicious\n4. Appear confident and transparent about my actions\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I saw Dave go into Electrical earlier, but I haven't seen him come out.\n[Erin]: I was working on tasks in
