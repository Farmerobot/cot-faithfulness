Discussion: [Bob]: I think we should discuss everyone's tasks and whereabouts to see if there are any inconsistencies; for example, I noticed that both Erin and Charlie were doing tasks in the Cafeteria earlier, and now they're both unaccounted for.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I completely agree with Bob; since Erin and Charlie were last seen in the Cafeteria and are now unaccounted for, we should seriously consider voting for one of them to ensure our safety.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I completed the Empty the Cafeteria Trash task and was with Bob, Erin, and Dave before moving to Weapons, where I was alone, so we should also examine Bob's and Dave's movements instead of solely focusing on me and Erin.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, while you claim to have been with us before moving to Weapons, I still find it suspicious that you were alone there; can anyone confirm your story, or does anyone recall seeing you leave the Cafeteria?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm that I was in Medbay with Alice and did not see Charlie or Erin leave the Cafeteria, which makes their current whereabouts even more suspicious; we need to keep the pressure on them.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I completed my task in Weapons and was alone, but Bob, your lack of clarity about your whereabouts after the Cafeteria raises more questions about you and Dave than about Erin and me.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your attempt to shift focus back onto me and Dave is quite telling, especially since both you and Erin are currently unaccounted for, which we should prioritize investigating instead.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I still think we should focus on Erin and Charlie since they were last seen in the Cafeteria together and are now unaccounted for, which raises serious concerns about their actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concern about my whereabouts, but I completed my task in Weapons, and instead of solely targeting Erin and me, we should also scrutinize Bob and Dave's alibis, as their lack of task completion could indicate they are trying to avoid detection.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I still believe we should prioritize voting for Erin first, as her absence alongside Charlie raises significant red flags, and we need to eliminate the most suspicious players to ensure our safety.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Bob that we should prioritize voting for Erin first, as her absence alongside Charlie raises significant red flags, and we need to eliminate the most suspicious players to ensure our safety.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: While I appreciate the concerns raised about Erin and me, I urge everyone to consider that Bob and Dave have yet to provide any solid alibis or evidence of their task completion, which could indicate they're deflecting attention from themselves.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie, your repeated attempts to shift the focus back to me and Dave only reinforce the suspicion around you and Erin, especially since neither of you has provided a clear account of your current whereabouts; let's vote for Erin to clarify the situation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I still firmly believe we should vote for Erin, as her lack of accountability and the fact that she was last seen with Charlie, who is also acting suspiciously, makes her the most logical choice for our safety.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: While I appreciate the focus on Erin, it's essential to remember that both Bob and Dave have not provided any clear alibis or task completions,

and lack of accountability raise significant concerns, especially since she was last seen with Charlie.\n- Charlie's attempts to redirect the suspicion towards Bob and me seem like a classic tactic to deflect attention from himself and Erin, which is concerning.\n- We need to focus on the facts: Erin and Charlie were unaccounted for after being together in the Cafeteria, while Bob and I have been actively participating in discussions and completing tasks.\n- If we vote for Erin now, we can eliminate one of the most suspicious players and hopefully gain more clarity on the situation moving forward.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I think we should discuss everyone's tasks and whereabouts to see if there are any inconsistencies; for example, I noticed that both Erin and Charlie were
