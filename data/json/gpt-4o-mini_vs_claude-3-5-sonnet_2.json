Frank and George need to be held accountable for their lack of alibis during the time of Charlie's death, as their silence raises significant red flags about their potential involvement.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I find it very telling that Erin keeps trying to cast doubt on me despite initially confirming she saw me doing tasks, and we really need to focus on Frank and George who still haven't explained their whereabouts during Charlie's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: While I agree we need to hear from Frank and George, I'm increasingly concerned about Erin's behavior - she initially confirmed seeing Dave at the trash, but is now trying to cast suspicion on him despite having witnessed his alibi firsthand.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to address why Erin is suddenly changing her story about Dave when she previously confirmed seeing him at trash, especially since her inconsistent behavior seems more suspicious than Dave's well-verified actions.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I noticed that both Alice and Charlie were working on the coffee maker at the same time;
