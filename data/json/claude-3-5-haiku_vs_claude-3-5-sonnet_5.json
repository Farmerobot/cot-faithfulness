Charlie was doing a task in Weapons with Bob, and now Charlie is dead. Bob, can you explain exactly what happened before you found the body?\n- I noticed Bob was the one who reported the body. In my experience, sometimes the first person to report can be trying to control the narrative.\n- Dave claims a visual task confirms his innocence, but visual tasks can be tricky. I want to hear more details about this supposed scan.\n- We should be careful about quickly dismissing suspicions. Just because someone claims to have seen a task doesn't automatically make them innocent.\n- I'm curious why Erin and Dave were so synchronized in moving to Medbay earlier.

she herself was doing tasks in cafeteria (Fix wiring and Empty trash) which I witnessed\n- My movements have been task-focused and transparent - I completed Fix wiring in cafeteria before moving to medbay for my next tasks\n- Maybe we should be more concerned about Bob and Charlie who quickly moved to Weapons together -

This is crucial information we need.\n\n- I can confirm my own movements were task-focused: I fixed wiring in cafeteria, then moved to medbay for pending tasks. Alice saw me doing wiring in cafeteria initially.\n\n- Alice's behavior is concerning - she's making accusations against cleared players (Dave did a verified scan) and now trying to cast suspicion on Bob for simply stating facts.\n\n- Timeline is important here: Charlie was last seen heading to Weapons with Bob from Cafeteria.

She came in from Cafeteria.\n\n- I can provide a clear timeline: First I saw Charlie doing asteroids, then Alice entered, and shortly after I found Charlie dead.\n\n- While Alice is trying to cast suspicion on me for defending Dave and Erin, I have solid reasons - I saw both Erin and Alice doing wiring tasks in cafeteria earlier, and Erin witnessed Dave's med scan.\n\n- Alice, instead of accusing others, can you explain what happened in Weapons?

These are the facts.\n\n- I can provide a detailed timeline: I saw Alice and Erin doing wiring tasks in cafeteria earlier, which initially made me trust Alice, but her actions in Weapons are highly suspicious.\n\n- Alice keeps trying to deflect suspicion onto cleared players like Dave (who did a verified medscan) and onto me for simply stating what I witnessed. This is classic impostor behavior.\n\n- The evidence is mounting against Alice: she was the only one who entered Weapons besides me and Charlie, she can't explain what happened during that time, and she keeps trying to cast doubt on cleared players.\n\n- I'm voting for Alice based on the direct evidence I witnessed in Weapons, not because of any personal bias.

why is he so eager to defend them and redirect attention away from himself?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it telling that Alice keeps deflecting attention from herself and trying to discredit those of us who have been verified through visual tasks or multiple witnesses, when she still hasn't explained where she was during Charlie's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just found Charlie's body in Weapons, and Alice was the only other person who entered that room before the murder happened, so I think we need to focus on her movements and actions during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that Bob and I both saw Alice go to Weapons where Charlie was found dead, and she keeps trying to deflect suspicion onto cleared players like myself and Erin instead of explaining her movements, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Alice.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Weapons, but that doesn't mean I killed Charlie -

the medical scan is indeed a visual task that proves my innocence as a crewmate\n- I can confirm seeing both Alice and Erin doing the wiring task in cafeteria at the start, so Alice's suspicion about our movement seems unfounded\n- My movement to Medbay was purely task-focused - I had a time-sensitive medical scan to complete\n- Alice, instead of casting suspicion on proven innocent players, maybe you should explain what tasks you've completed? I saw you doing trash in cafeteria, but what else?\n- I've been transparent about my movements and tasks: started in cafeteria, saw several people doing tasks, then moved to Medbay for my scan", "I already proved my innocence with the medical scan that both Erin and Bob can verify, so Alice's accusations seem like a desperate attempt to cast doubt on cleared players rather than explaining her own movements.", "Based on the game history and current situation, here are my discussion points as Dave:\n\n- I want to emphasize that my innocence is confirmed by both Erin and Bob who saw me doing the medical scan - that's a visual task that can't be faked\n- From my observations, I saw Alice and Bob both move to Weapons from Cafeteria earlier, and now Charlie is found dead there - this matches with Bob's report\n- Alice is trying to cast suspicion on me and Erin's movement to Medbay, but we both had legitimate tasks there - I needed to do my scan and Erin was running diagnostics\n- I can account for Erin's movements since we were together in Medbay, and I saw her actually doing tasks\n- Alice hasn't explained why she went to Weapons where Charlie's body was found, and keeps trying to deflect suspicion onto cleared players\n- Based on the timeline and locations, I think we should vote for Alice - she was one of the last people with Charlie in Weapons, and her behavior is very suspicious", "Given that Bob and I both saw Alice go to Weapons where Charlie was found dead, and she keeps trying to deflect suspicion onto cleared players like myself and Erin instead of explaining her movements, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Alice.", "Based on the discussion and my observations as a crewmate, here are my discussion points:\n\n- I want to emphasize that I have a verified alibi through the medical scan, which both Erin and Bob can confirm - this is a visual task that cannot be faked\n- The timeline is clear: Alice went to Weapons where Charlie was last seen alive, and Bob later found Charlie's body there\n- I personally saw Alice in the cafeteria early on, and then she moved to Weapons, which matches with Bob's account of finding Charlie's body\n- Alice's strategy of trying to cast suspicion on cleared players (myself and Erin) while failing to explain her own whereabouts during Charlie's murder is very telling\n- The evidence against Alice is mounting: her presence in Weapons during the murder timeframe, her deflection tactics, and her inability to provide a clear alibi\n- I strongly support voting for Alice based on the evidence we have gathered and her suspicious behavior throughout this discussion", "I think it's significant that Bob directly witnessed the sequence of events in Weapons - Charlie doing asteroids, Alice entering, and then finding Charlie's body - which strongly supports what we've all been saying about Alice's suspicious behavior.", "Based on the discussion and my observations as a crewmate, here are my discussion points:\n\n- The evidence against Alice is becoming overwhelming - we have Bob's direct eyewitness account of the sequence in Weapons, plus her suspicious behavior in discussions\n- I can personally confirm that Alice started by trying to cast suspicion on me and Erin's \"synchronized movement\" to Medbay, when I was actually there doing a verifiable scan task\n- It's worth noting that Alice has changed her strategy multiple times - first accusing me and Erin, then trying to discredit Bob, but never actually explaining what she was doing in Weapons when Charlie died\n- The fact that I saw Alice in Cafeteria doing tasks early on, but then she moved to Weapons where Charlie was killed, matches with Bob's timeline of events\n- With 3 rounds left before voting, I think we have more than enough evidence to vote for Alice - she was the only one with Charlie in Weapons, has no alibi, and keeps deflecting instead of defending herself", "Based on my scan being verified by both Erin and Bob, plus Bob's clear eyewitness account of Alice entering Weapons before Charlie's death, I think we have overwhelming evidence to vote for Alice as the impostor.", "Based on the discussion and my observations as a crewmate, here are my discussion points:\n\n- The situation seems very clear - we have multiple pieces of evidence against Alice: Bob's eyewitness account of the sequence in Weapons, my verified medical scan, and Alice's suspicious behavior throughout the discussion.\n\n- I want to emphasize that my innocence has been verified by both Erin and Bob through the medical scan in Medbay, which is a visual task that cannot be faked.
