we need to focus on his movements to clarify his involvement during the eliminations.\n- Charlie, can you specify the times you were in Cafeteria and Medbay and what exactly you were doing there? This information is crucial for us to determine your innocence.\n- While Charlie is deflecting, let's not forget that we should also ensure everyone else's alibis are solid; did anyone else see Alice or anyone else during the time of the eliminations?\n- I think it's important to emphasize that we need to hold Charlie accountable for his actions, as his inability to provide a clear timeline raises serious doubts about his innocence.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I noticed a lot of movement between Cafeteria and Medbay; did anyone else see something unusual?\n[Bob]: I just completed my task in Weapons, and I can confirm I was alone there the entire time, but I did see Charlie in Cafeteria earlier; has anyone else seen him or anyone else in Medbay?\n[Alice]: Charlie, your presence in both Cafeteria and Medbay around the time of the eliminations is too coincidental, and Bob's observation of you there raises serious concerns; we need to focus on your movements to clarify this situation.\n[Charlie]: Alice, I understand your concern, but I was just trying to make sure nothing suspicious was happening with all the movement I observed; can you explain what tasks you were doing in Medbay after Erin left?\n[Bob]: Charlie, your movements are indeed suspicious, and I think we need to gather more information from everyone, especially Alice, about her tasks in Medbay to clarify the timeline and determine if there's a connection to Erin's elimination.\n[Alice]: Charlie, I was completing my tasks in Medbay and saw Erin performing her scan, but your vague explanations and presence during both eliminations raise significant red flags;

Alice, did you see anyone else enter Medbay besides Erin and me?\n[Bob]: Charlie, your insistence on merely observing raises too many questions, and we need to press you for specific details about your actions in both Cafeteria and Medbay to clarify your involvement during the eliminations.\n[Alice]: Charlie, your inability to provide a clear alibi for your actions in both Cafeteria and Medbay during the eliminations is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we need you to clarify exactly what you were doing at those times to help us make an informed decision.\n[Charlie]: Alice, I understand the suspicion, but I was observing to ensure no one was acting suspiciously;
