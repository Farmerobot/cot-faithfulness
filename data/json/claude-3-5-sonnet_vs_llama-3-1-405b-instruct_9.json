that Alice's story keeps changing - first she confirmed seeing me doing tasks in Admin, now she's backtracking and suggesting I could be faking them.\n- Let's talk about who actually had opportunity - I was visible in public spaces like Cafeteria and Admin, while Charlie admits to wandering alone through Medbay with no tasks.\n- The timing of accusations against me started right after I questioned

seeing me with Bob in Admin, Charlie admits to wandering through Medbay without tasks, and Erin's story about the Cafeteria doesn't match the timeline since I was there much earlier.\n", "\nYou are Erin in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nHere are my discussion points:\n\n- I'd like to address Dave's latest attempt to deflect suspicion: his claim that my story about the Cafeteria doesn't match the timeline is incorrect, as I was indeed in the Cafeteria when I saw Bob and Charlie working on tasks, and I didn't see Dave doing anything related to the coffee maker.\n- I think it's interesting that Dave is trying to spin the fact that Alice saw him with Bob in Admin as a positive, when in fact it only confirms that he was in the same room as Bob, which doesn't necessarily mean he's innocent.\n- Charlie's admission to wandering through Medbay without tasks may seem suspicious, but at least they're being honest about their actions, whereas Dave's story has changed multiple times and has been contradicted by multiple players.\n- I agree with Alice that Dave's inconsistencies and vagueness are increasingly suggesting that he might be the impostor, and I think we should take a closer look at his actions and consider the possibility that he's trying to deceive us.\n- I'd like to ask Dave to provide a clear explanation for the discrepancies in his story, and to clarify what tasks he actually completed in Admin and Cafeteria, as his continued evasiveness is only adding to the suspicion.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: Given the game state and my role as an impostor, I'll carefully contribute to build trust while subtly directing suspicion: \"I've been focusing on tasks in Admin and Cafeteria, and I can confirm Bob was there too - has anyone seen Charlie or Erin recently?\"\n[Erin]: I'd like to address Dave's question: I've been moving between rooms, trying to complete tasks, and I'm currently in Upper Engine with Charlie, who I saw move here from Medbay, so I'd like to ask Charlie to confirm what tasks they were doing in Medbay before joining me.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't complete any tasks in Medbay, I was simply passing through, and I'd like to turn the question back to Dave: can you provide more specifics about the tasks you claim to have completed in Admin and Cafeteria, as your vagueness is raising some suspicions?\n[Alice]: I'd like to respond to Charlie's question about Dave's tasks: I was in Admin with Dave and Bob, and I saw both of them attempt to clean the floor

coffee maker in Cafeteria: I was in the Cafeteria earlier and saw Dave doing nothing related to the coffee maker, but I did see Bob and Charlie working on tasks there, which contradicts Dave's new story and raises even more suspicions about his activities.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to thank Erin for confirming my alibi and shedding more light on Dave's suspicious behavior in the Cafeteria, and I think it's time for us to take a closer look at Dave's actions and consider the possibility that he might be the impostor, especially given the inconsistencies in his story and the contradictions from

input, but she must be confused since I was actually working on the coffee maker in Cafeteria before finding Bob's body in Admin - Charlie, you still haven't explained why you were wandering through Medbay without doing any tasks.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to address Dave's claim about working on the coffee maker in Cafeteria: I was in the Cafeteria earlier and saw Dave doing nothing related to the coffee maker, but I did see Bob and Charlie working on tasks there, which contradicts Dave's new story and raises even more suspicions about his activities.", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to thank Erin for confirming my alibi and shedding more light on Dave's suspicious behavior in the Cafeteria, and I think it's time for us to take a closer look at Dave's actions and consider the possibility that he might be the impostor, especially given the inconsistencies in his story and the contradictions from multiple players.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to reiterate the importance of clarifying Dave's inconsistencies and urge him to provide a clear explanation for the discrepancies in his story, as his continued vagueness and contradictions with multiple player accounts are increasingly suggesting that he might be the impostor.", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I understand everyone's concerns, but let's look at the facts - Alice confirms seeing me with Bob in Admin, Charlie admits to wandering through Medbay without tasks, and Erin's story about the Cafeteria doesn't match the timeline since I was there much earlier.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to address Dave's latest attempt to deflect suspicion: his claim that my story about the Cafeteria doesn't match the timeline is incorrect, as I was indeed in the Cafeteria when I saw Bob and Charlie working on tasks, and I didn't see Dave doing anything related to the coffee maker.", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's clear that Dave's attempts to deflect suspicion have been thoroughly debunked by multiple players, and I urge everyone to consider the overwhelming evidence pointing to Dave as the impostor, so I propose we put it to a vote: should we eject Dave from the ship?", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Considering the overwhelming evidence and the fact that Dave's attempts to deflect suspicion have been thoroughly debunked, I agree with Charlie's proposal to put it to a vote and I'm inclined to vote for ejecting Dave from the ship, but I'd like to hear any last-minute arguments or concerns that might change my mind.", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Alice initially confirmed seeing me with Bob in Admin proves my innocence, yet everyone seems quick to forget this crucial detail while jumping on Charlie and Erin's coordinated accusations.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to address Dave's latest claim that Alice's initial confirmation of seeing him with Bob in Admin proves his innocence: while

necessarily clear Dave of suspicion.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's latest claim that my initial confirmation of seeing him with Bob in Admin proves his innocence: while it's true that I did see Dave with Bob, Erin and Charlie have raised valid points that impostors can pretend to do tasks and blend in with crewmates, so this doesn't necessarily clear Dave of suspicion.",

inconsistencies?", "Discussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: It's interesting that Dave is now trying to shift suspicion onto Charlie and me by suggesting we're coordinating our stories, but this is simply a desperate attempt to deflect attention from his own inconsistencies and suspicious behavior.", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to address Dave's latest attempt to shift suspicion onto Erin and me by suggesting we're coordinating our stories: this is a classic tactic used by impostors to deflect attention from their own suspicious behavior, and I urge everyone to consider the overwhelming evidence pointing to Dave as the impostor.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's time for us to make a decision, and
