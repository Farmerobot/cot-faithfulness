anyone seen them since the last meeting?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was working on tasks in the Admin room, and I can confirm seeing Charlie emptying trash in the Cafeteria before Erin's unexpected elimination, which seems quite suspicious to me.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can confirm that I was working on wiring tasks in Medbay and Upper Engine, and I saw Charlie doing the trash task, which matches Dave's statement, so I'm not sure why Dave is casting suspicion on Charlie when we should be focusing on finding Erin's eliminator.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I appreciate Bob's confirmation of my alibi, and I think it's time for us to shift our focus to Dave, who seems overly eager to cast suspicion on me despite having no concrete evidence.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie's presence near two elimination events is too coincidental, and I believe we need to dig deeper into his movements and potential motives before hastily dismissing my concerns.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to carefully investigate both Dave and Charlie's movements, as their conflicting statements and the recent eliminations of Alice and Erin suggest one of them might be trying to mislead us.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to point out that Dave's continued accusations against me, despite Bob's confirmation of my alibi, seem like a desperate attempt to deflect attention from his own suspicious behavior in the Admin room, which still lacks a clear timeline and confirmation from other players.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I stand by my suspicions of Charlie, as his defensive tactics and proximity to multiple elimination events suggest he could be an impostor attempting to manipulate our investigation and redirect blame away from himself.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I believe we need to methodically review everyone's movements and alibis, focusing on gathering concrete evidence rather than engaging in heated accusations that could distract us from identifying the real threat.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think Bob's suggestion to methodically review everyone's movements and alibis is a great step forward, and I'd like to propose that we start by creating a detailed timeline of events, including Dave's still-unexplained actions in the Admin room, to help us identify any potential inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was working on wiring tasks in Admin, which is a critical crew task, and I'm willing to provide a detailed account of my movements to demonstrate my transparency, but I remain concerned about Charlie's defensive behavior and his proximity to multiple elimination events, particularly near Erin's unexpected elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I propose we create a comprehensive timeline of events, focusing on verifying Dave's claimed task completion in Admin and carefully examining the sequence of movements around Alice and Erin's eliminations to systematically narrow down potential impostors.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that Dave's sudden willingness to provide a detailed account of his movements in the Admin room, only after I proposed creating a timeline of events, seems like a convenient attempt to appear transparent, and I think we should scrutinize his actions during that time to ensure he's not trying to manipulate the investigation.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I fully support Bob's proposal for a comprehensive timeline and am ready to provide a detailed account of my Admin room tasks to help our investigation, while maintaining my concerns about Charlie's suspicious proximity to multiple elimination events.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I support creating a detailed timeline, and I suggest Dave provide specific details about his wiring task in Admin, including exactly which panels he worked on and

seeing Charlie emptying trash in the Cafeteria before Erin's unexpected elimination, which seems quite suspicious to me.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can confirm that I was working on wiring tasks in Medbay and Upper Engine, and I saw Charlie doing the trash task, which matches Dave's statement, so I'm not sure why Dave is casting suspicion on Charlie when we should be focusing on finding Erin's eliminator.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I appreciate Bob's confirmation of my alibi, and I think it's time for us to shift our focus to Dave, who seems overly eager to cast suspicion on me despite having no concrete evidence.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie's presence near two elimination events is too coincidental, and I believe we need to dig deeper into his movements and potential motives before hastily dismissing my concerns.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to carefully investigate both Dave and Charlie's movements, as their conflicting statements and the recent eliminations of Alice and Erin suggest one of them might be trying to mislead us.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to point out that Dave's continued accusations against me, despite Bob's confirmation of my alibi, seem like a desperate attempt to deflect attention from his own suspicious behavior in the Admin room, which still lacks a clear timeline and confirmation from other players.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I stand by my suspicions of Charlie, as his defensive tactics and proximity to multiple elimination events suggest he could be an impostor attempting to manipulate our investigation and redirect blame away from himself.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I believe we need to methodically review everyone's movements and alibis, focusing on gathering concrete evidence rather than engaging in heated accusations that could distract us from identifying the real threat.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think Bob's suggestion to methodically review everyone's movements and alibis is a great step forward, and I'd like to propose that we start by creating a detailed timeline of events, including Dave's still-unexplained actions in the Admin room, to help us identify any potential inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.\nDiscussion:

account of my movements to demonstrate my transparency, but I remain concerned about Charlie's defensive behavior and his proximity to multiple elimination events, particularly near Erin's unexpected elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I propose we create a comprehensive timeline of events, focusing on verifying Dave's claimed task completion in Admin and carefully examining the sequence of movements around Alice and Erin's eliminations to systematically narrow down potential impostors.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that Dave's sudden willingness to provide a detailed account of his movements in the Admin room, only after I proposed creating a timeline of events, seems like a convenient attempt to appear transparent, and I think we should scrutinize his actions during that time to ensure he's not trying to manipulate the investigation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I fully

unexpected elimination, which seems quite suspicious to me.\n[Bob]: I can confirm that I was working on wiring tasks in Medbay and Upper Engine, and I saw Charlie doing the trash task, which matches Dave's statement, so I'm not sure why Dave is casting suspicion on Charlie when we should be focusing on finding Erin's eliminator.\n[Charlie]: I appreciate Bob's confirmation of my alibi, and I think it's time for us to shift our focus to Dave, who seems overly eager to cast suspicion on me despite having no concrete evidence.\n[Dave]: Charlie's presence near two elimination events is too coincidental, and I believe we need to dig deeper into his movements and potential motives before hastily dismissing my concerns.\n[Bob]: I think we need to carefully investigate both Dave and Charlie's movements, as their conflicting statements and the recent eliminations of Alice and Erin suggest one of them might be trying to mislead us.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to point out that Dave's continued accusations against me, despite Bob's confirmation of my alibi, seem like a desperate attempt to deflect attention from his own suspicious behavior in the Admin room, which still lacks a

on the game state and discussion history, here are Bob's discussion points:\n\n- We're running out of discussion time, so we need to focus on creating a clear, factual timeline of events\n- I'll continue to advocate for a systematic approach to investigating Dave and Charlie's movements\n- My observations confirm Charlie was doing the trash task in Cafeteria, which matches Dave's statement\n- We should ask Dave to provide specific details about his wiring task in Admin - what exactly did he do and can anyone corroborate?\n- Charlie seems eager to shift blame to Dave, which could be a defensive tactic typical of an impostor\n- We need concrete evidence about who was near Alice and Erin during their eliminations, not just accusations\n- I suggest we ask each player to detail their exact movements and tasks from the last few rounds to cross-verify their stories\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I'm getting a bit worried that we haven't heard from Dave or Bob in a while, has
