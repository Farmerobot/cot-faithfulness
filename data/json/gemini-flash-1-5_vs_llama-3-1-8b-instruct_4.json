I'll admit, my task was somewhat mundane and I may not have noticed anything out of the ordinary.\n\n- Let's focus on the tasks at hand.  Accusations without concrete evidence are unproductive.

Creating one sounds like a great idea to weed out inconsistencies.  However, focusing solely on my movements might be a distraction.  Shouldn't we also consider the movements of others?  Perhaps someone else had the opportunity to eliminate Bob.\n\n-  Let's be careful not to jump to conclusions based on limited information.  I admit I was focused on my task, and it's possible I missed something.  But isn't it equally possible that others could have missed Bob's body as well?  We should be examining everyone's alibis with the same level of scrutiny.\n\n-  I'm happy to cooperate fully with the timeline request, but I suggest we all participate.

emergency meeting to discuss our progress and coordinate our efforts, as I mentioned earlier, and I'd like to add that we should also discuss Charlie's claim of being in the cafeteria and see if

meeting is warranted, and while I was in the cafeteria, I understand Alice's concerns and am happy to clarify any discrepancies about my movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to propose that we start by asking Charlie to explain why he didn't notice or report Bob's dead body in the Admin room, considering he claims to have been in the area and was supposed to empty the trash, which might have given him a clear view of the room and any potential issues.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's crucial that we
