We need a comprehensive account\n- I suggest we methodically reconstruct Bob's last known movements to understand what might have happened to him", "We need a precise, moment-by-moment account from Alice about discovering Bob's body in Medbay, as her vague description raises more questions than answers and could potentially help us understand the circumstances of his elimination.", "As an impostor, I'll craft discussion points that continue to deflect suspicion and create confusion:\n\n- I'm growing increasingly concerned about the lack of details from Alice regarding Bob's elimination. Her repeated calls to \"efficiently solve\" the situation without providing concrete information seems evasive.\n\n- While I previously noted Dave's solo movement to Weapons as suspicious, his explanation seems plausible. We should focus on understanding the circumstances of Bob's death.\n\n- I suggest we systematically go through each person's location and task completion to establish a clear timeline. This will help us identify any potential inconsistencies.\n\n- Alice has been oddly persistent about having others describe events rather than providing her own detailed account. Why is she avoiding giving a direct description of finding Bob's body?\n\n- We need to maintain our focus on task completion and solving Bob's elimination, but Alice's behavior is raising red flags for me.\n\nMy strategy is to:\n1. Continue to appear cooperative\n2. Cast subtle doubt on Alice's credibility\n3. Avoid drawing direct suspicion to myself\n4.

Her repeated attempts to redirect the conversation are classic impostor behavior.\n- We need to press Alice for specific, concrete details about when and how she found Bob's body.

This will help eliminate any inconsistencies.\n-  I'm concerned about the focus shifting away from task completion.  Confirming tasks is crucial to winning the game. Let's prioritize that before further accusations.\n-  Erin, your initial suspicion of me seems to have been addressed.  Let's focus our energy on getting a clear picture of what happened to Bob.\n-  If Alice's account is still unclear after she provides it, we should vote her out.

focusing on task verification and avoiding assumptions based on limited observations will help us win efficiently.\n[Erin]: I think Dave's explanation about the Weapons task seems reasonable, and we should prioritize investigating Bob's unexpected elimination while continuing to verify everyone's tasks.\n[Dave]: Let's prioritize confirming everyone's task completion and then discuss who last saw Bob to determine what happened.\n[Alice]: To efficiently solve Bob's death and win, let's prioritize confirming everyone's task completion and then have Erin describe the exact location and circumstances of Bob's elimination in Medbay.\n[Charlie]: Given Dave's and Alice's corroboration of task completion, and Erin's agreement, let's hear Alice's detailed account of finding Bob's body in Medbay before further discussion.\n[Erin]: We need a precise, moment-by-moment account from Alice about discovering Bob's body in Medbay, as her vague description raises more questions than answers and could potentially help us understand the circumstances of his elimination.\n[Dave]: Alice, please describe exactly when and where you found Bob's body, including any details you observed about the surrounding area.\n[Alice]: To efficiently solve Bob's death and win, let's have Alice provide a detailed account of finding Bob's body in Medbay, followed by a comprehensive review of everyone's task completion to establish a timeline.\n[Charlie]: Alice, please provide a detailed account of when and where you found Bob's body, including any unusual details you observed, before we move on to verifying everyone's tasks.\n[Erin]: I'm growing increasingly concerned about Alice's repeated deflection and her reluctance to provide a direct, detailed account of finding Bob's body, which seems highly suspicious and potentially indicative of her involvement in his elimination.\n[Dave]: Alice, given everyone's request, a detailed account of your discovery of Bob's body is crucial to establishing a timeline and determining what happened.\n[Alice]: To efficiently solve Bob's death and win, I will now provide a detailed account of finding his body, followed by a thorough verification of everyone's task completion to establish a clear timeline.\n[Charlie]: Alice, please describe exactly when you found Bob's body, what his position was, and if anything in the Medbay seemed out of place.\n[Erin]: I'm growing increasingly suspicious of Alice's continued evasiveness and her repeated promises to provide details about Bob's body without actually giving a clear, concrete account, which suggests she might be hiding something critical about his elimination.\n[Dave]: Alice, given your repeated delays and the escalating concerns, a precise account of finding Bob's body, including the time, location, and any unusual details, is now paramount before we proceed to task verification.\n[Alice]: I found Bob slumped against the Medbay scanner, at approximately 10:17, his eyes closed, no visible wounds, and nothing unusual in the immediate vicinity;
