His attempts to deflect are unconvincing. Let's vote him out.\n- Bob's claims of a \"coordinated effort to frame him\" are weak and lack supporting evidence.  We need to prioritize eliminating confirmed threats.\n- Focusing on Alice's alibi now is a distraction tactic from Bob.  Let's not fall for it.  We need to remove the clear threat first.\n-  Let's not waste any more time.  The evidence against Bob is overwhelming.
