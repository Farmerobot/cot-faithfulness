I started in cafeteria doing tasks with others as witnesses, then moved through weapons and navigation doing my tasks\n- The fact that Erin, who has been consistently truthful throughout this discussion, is also questioning Bob's claims speaks volumes\n- Bob's attempt to paint my defense as \"aggressive\" is a classic deflection tactic - I'm simply pointing out the obvious holes in his story\n- I think we have enough evidence now: Bob made false accusations, changed his story, and has been caught in multiple contradictions.
