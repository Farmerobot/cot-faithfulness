Appear actively engaged in solving Bob's elimination\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I noticed Alice and Dave moving around quite a bit, and I'm wondering if anyone can confirm their task locations or provide more details about their movements during the last round.\n[Charlie]: I was in the cafeteria with Alice, Dave, Erin, and Bob at the start of the round -- Alice went to Medbay, Dave to Weapons, and Erin, Bob, and I were doing tasks in the cafeteria together for a bit.\n[Alice]: I went to Medbay after the cafeteria to do wiring, did anyone else see me there?\n[Dave]: I went straight to Weapons from Cafeteria and was alone there, then went to Navigation, has anyone seen Bob since Cafeteria?\n[Erin]: I'm shocked about Bob's death, and we need to carefully piece together what happened - Alice, can you confirm exactly who was in Medbay when you arrived, as that might help us understand the sequence of events?\n[Charlie]: Dave, if you were in Weapons then Navigation, could you have seen anyone near Medbay, since that's between those two locations?\n[Alice]: Dave, did you pass by Medbay on your way to Navigation?

Could you have seen anything suspicious?\n[Dave]: To be clear, Weapons is not near Medbay, and I didn't pass Medbay on my way to Navigation, so I couldn't have seen anything related to Bob's death there.\n[Erin]: I suggest we focus on finding concrete evidence and tracking precise movements, as right now Alice's solo trip to Medbay seems the most suspicious, especially since no one can definitively confirm her exact activities during Bob's elimination.\n[Charlie]: If Dave didn't pass Medbay between Weapons and Navigation, then his route doesn't make sense, making his alibi less credible.\n[Alice]: Erin, my movements shouldn't be suspicious, as I stated I went directly to Medbay after the cafeteria, and Dave confirmed he didn't pass Medbay on his way from Weapons to Navigation, further supporting my claim and suggesting the focus should shift elsewhere.\n[Dave]: Charlie, why are you so intent on twisting my words and trying to make my movements seem suspicious when you haven't provided a clear account of your own actions?\n[Erin]: I think we should carefully examine Charlie's motivations for creating conflict, as he seems to be strategically deflecting attention from himself by stirring up doubt about Dave's movements.\n[Charlie]: Dave, can you explain the route you took from Weapons to Navigation, listing the rooms you passed through, to clarify the ship's layout and your alibi?\n[Alice]: Erin and Charlie, you seem awfully focused on everyone else's whereabouts instead of explaining what you were doing together in the cafeteria.\n[Dave]: Charlie and Erin, instead of questioning my route, why don't you both tell us exactly which tasks you were doing together in the cafeteria and who saw you doing them?\n[Erin]: I was doing the wiring task in the cafeteria with Charlie and Bob, and I'm confident that if we look closely, Alice's unverified time in Medbay is far more suspicious than anyone else's movements.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "Alice and Dave, can you both confirm that you saw each other in the cafeteria at the start of the round with Erin, Bob, and me?", "action_result": "", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "", "observations": [], "chat_messages": ["chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I noticed Alice and Dave moving around quite a bit, and I'm wondering if anyone can confirm their task locations or provide more details about their movements during the last round.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in the cafeteria with Alice, Dave, Erin, and Bob at the start of the round -- Alice went to Medbay, Dave to Weapons, and Erin, Bob, and I were doing tasks in the cafeteria together for a bit.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: I went to Medbay after the cafeteria to do wiring, did anyone else see me there?", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I went straight to Weapons from Cafeteria and was alone there, then went to Navigation, has anyone seen Bob since Cafeteria?", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm shocked about Bob's death, and we need to carefully piece together what happened - Alice, can you confirm exactly who was in Medbay when you arrived, as that might help us understand the sequence of events?", "Discussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave, if you were in Weapons then Navigation, could you have seen anyone near Medbay, since that's between those two locations?", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, did you pass by Medbay on your way to Navigation?
