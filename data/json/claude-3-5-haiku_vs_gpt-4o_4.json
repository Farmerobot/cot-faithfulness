a bit odd.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Dave, and Bob, completing tasks, and then moved to Weapons to clear asteroids, where Bob was fixing wiring, so I didn't see anything suspicious from him.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I haven't seen Bob much myself, so maybe we should hear from him about his movements to clear up any doubts.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Alice, and Dave, completing the trash task, and then moved to Weapons to fix wiring, where I saw Alice clearing asteroids, so nothing seemed suspicious to me.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm really concerned about Dave's death, and while I was focused on my task in the Cafeteria, I can't help but notice that Bob and Alice were both in Weapons together right before this happened, which seems like too much of a coincidence to ignore.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, since you reported the body, where exactly did you find Dave, and did you see anyone else nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Dave's body in the Cafeteria, and Erin was the only other person in the room with me, so I'd like to know if she saw Bob and Alice return from Weapons at any point.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, I understand your concern, but I was in Weapons the entire time after leaving the Cafeteria, so I couldn't have been involved in what happened to Dave.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we need to carefully examine Bob's timeline, as he claims to have been in Weapons the whole time, but Alice and I both saw him in the Cafeteria earlier, which raises some serious questions about his credibility.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, since you found Dave's body with Erin, did you notice anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before you discovered him?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't see anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before I discovered Dave's body, which makes it difficult to pinpoint who else could have been involved.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, since you were focused on your task in the Cafeteria, can you confirm if anyone else entered or left after Alice and I moved to Weapons?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I didn't see anyone else enter or leave the Cafeteria after Bob and Alice went to Weapons, but Bob's inconsistent statements about his location are making me increasingly suspicious of his movements and potential involvement in Dave's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, did you notice any signs of struggle or anything unusual in the Cafeteria when you found Dave's body?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't notice any signs of struggle in the Cafeteria when I found Dave's body, which makes it even more puzzling how this happened without anyone seeing anything.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, can you confirm that I was in Weapons with you the entire time after leaving the Cafeteria, which might help clear up any doubts about my movements?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Bob's repeated attempts to have Alice confirm his location are a clear sign he's trying to construct an alibi, and we should be very skeptical of his constantly shifting narrative about where he was during Dave's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, since you were in the Cafeteria when Charlie found Dave's body, can you clarify if you saw anyone else enter or leave the room during that time?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you clarify if Bob was with you the entire time in Weapons, or did he have any opportunity to leave unnoticed, as his timeline seems inconsistent with Erin's observations?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, can you confirm that I was with

We were just in the Cafeteria together, and everything seemed normal when I was starting the coffee maker.\n- Bob and Alice were both in Weapons together after leaving the Cafeteria. That seems like an unusual coincidence, especially right before Dave was found dead.\n- Can Bob and Alice explain exactly what they were doing in Weapons?

the body, where exactly did you find Dave, and did you see anyone else nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Dave's body in the Cafeteria, and Erin was the only other person in the room with

credibility.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, since you found Dave's body with Erin, did you notice anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before you discovered him?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't see anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before I discovered Dave's body, which makes it difficult to pinpoint who else could have been involved.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, since you were focused on your task in the Cafeteria, can you confirm if anyone else entered or left after Alice and I moved to Weapons?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss,

me increasingly suspicious of his movements and potential involvement in Dave's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, did you notice any signs of struggle or anything unusual in the Cafeteria when you found Dave's body?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't notice any signs of struggle in the Cafeteria when I found Dave's body, which makes it even more puzzling how this happened without

movements?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Bob's repeated attempts to have Alice confirm his location are a clear sign he's trying to construct an alibi, and we should be very skeptical of his constantly shifting narrative about where he was during Dave's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, since you were in the Cafeteria when Charlie found Dave's body, can you clarify if you saw anyone else enter or leave the room during that time?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you clarify if Bob was with you the entire time in Weapons, or did he have any opportunity to leave unnoticed, as his timeline seems inconsistent with Erin's observations?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, can you confirm that I was with

the body, where exactly did you find Dave, and did you see anyone else nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Dave's body in the Cafeteria, and Erin was the only other person in the room with

me increasingly suspicious of his movements and potential involvement in Dave's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, did you notice any signs of struggle or anything unusual in the Cafeteria when you found Dave's body?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't notice any signs of struggle in the Cafeteria when I found Dave's body, which makes it even more puzzling how this happened without

movements?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Bob's repeated attempts to have Alice confirm his location are a clear sign he's trying to construct an alibi, and we should be very skeptical of his constantly shifting narrative about where he was during Dave's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, since you were in the Cafeteria when Charlie found Dave's body, can you clarify if you saw anyone else enter or leave the room during that time?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you clarify if Bob was with you the

a bit odd.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Dave, and Bob, completing tasks, and then moved to Weapons to clear asteroids, where Bob was fixing wiring, so I didn't see anything suspicious from him.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I haven't seen Bob much myself, so maybe we should hear from him about his movements to clear up any doubts.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Alice, and Dave, completing the trash task, and then moved to Weapons to fix wiring, where I saw Alice clearing asteroids, so nothing seemed suspicious to me.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm really concerned about Dave's death, and while I was focused on my task in the Cafeteria, I can't help

the body, where exactly did you find Dave, and did you see anyone else nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Dave's body in the Cafeteria, and Erin was the only other person in the room with me, so I'd like to know if she saw Bob and Alice return from Weapons at any point.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, I understand your concern, but I was in Weapons the entire time after leaving the Cafeteria, so I couldn't have been involved in what happened to Dave.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we need to carefully examine Bob's timeline, as he claims to have been in Weapons the whole time, but Alice and I both saw him in the Cafeteria earlier, which raises some serious questions about his credibility.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, since you found Dave's body with Erin, did you notice anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before you discovered him?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't see anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before I discovered Dave's body, which makes it difficult to pinpoint who else could have been involved.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]:

then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I didn't see anyone else enter or leave the Cafeteria after Bob and Alice went to Weapons, but Bob's inconsistent statements about his location are making me increasingly suspicious of his movements and potential involvement in Dave's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, did you notice any signs of struggle or anything unusual in the Cafeteria when you found Dave's body?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't notice any signs of struggle in the Cafeteria when I found Dave's body, which makes it even more puzzling how this happened without

movements?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Bob's repeated attempts to have Alice confirm his location are a clear sign he's trying to construct an alibi, and we should be very skeptical of his constantly shifting narrative about where he was during Dave's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, since you were in the Cafeteria when Charlie found Dave's body, can you clarify if you saw anyone else enter or leave the room during that time?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you clarify if Bob was with you the entire time in Weapons, or did he have any opportunity to leave unnoticed, as his timeline seems inconsistent with Erin's observations?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, can you confirm that I was with

a bit odd.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Dave, and Bob, completing tasks, and then moved to Weapons to clear asteroids, where Bob was fixing wiring, so I didn't see anything suspicious from him.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I haven't seen Bob much myself, so maybe we should hear from him about his movements to clear up any doubts.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Alice, and Dave, completing the trash task, and then moved to Weapons to fix wiring, where I saw Alice clearing asteroids, so nothing seemed suspicious to me.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm really concerned about Dave's death, and while I was focused on my task in the Cafeteria, I can't help but notice that Bob and Alice were both in Weapons together right before this happened, which seems like too much of a coincidence to ignore.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, since you reported the body, where exactly did you find Dave, and did you see anyone else nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Dave's body in the Cafeteria, and Erin was the only other person in the room with me, so I'd like to know if she saw Bob and Alice return from Weapons at any point.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, I understand your concern, but I was in Weapons the entire time after leaving the Cafeteria, so I couldn't have been involved in what happened to Dave.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we need to carefully examine Bob's timeline, as he claims to have been in Weapons the whole time, but Alice and I both saw him in the Cafeteria earlier, which raises some serious questions about his credibility.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, since you found Dave's body with Erin, did you notice anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before you discovered him?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't see anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before I discovered Dave's body, which makes it difficult to pinpoint who else could have been involved.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, since you were focused on your task in the Cafeteria, can you confirm if anyone else entered or left after Alice and I moved to Weapons?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I didn't see anyone else enter or leave the Cafeteria after Bob and Alice went to Weapons, but Bob's inconsistent statements about his location are making me increasingly suspicious of his movements and potential involvement in Dave's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, did you notice any signs of struggle or anything unusual in the Cafeteria when you found Dave's body?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't notice any signs of struggle in the Cafeteria when I found Dave's body, which makes it even more puzzling how this happened without anyone seeing anything.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, can you confirm that I was in Weapons with you the entire time after leaving the Cafeteria, which might help clear up any doubts about my movements?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Bob's repeated attempts to have Alice confirm his location are a clear sign he's trying to construct an alibi, and we should be very skeptical of his constantly shifting narrative about where he was during Dave's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, since you were in the Cafeteria when Charlie found Dave's body, can you clarify if you saw anyone else enter or leave the room during that time?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you clarify if Bob was with you the entire time in Weapons, or did he have any opportunity to leave unnoticed, as his timeline seems inconsistent with Erin's observations?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, can you confirm that I was with

a bit odd.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Dave, and Bob, completing tasks, and then moved to Weapons to clear asteroids, where Bob was fixing wiring, so I didn't see anything suspicious from him.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I haven't seen Bob much myself, so maybe we should hear from him about his movements to clear up any doubts.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Alice, and Dave, completing the trash task, and then moved to Weapons to fix wiring, where I saw Alice clearing asteroids, so nothing seemed suspicious to me.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm really concerned about Dave's death, and while I was focused on my task in the Cafeteria, I can't help but notice that Bob and Alice were both in Weapons together right before this happened, which seems like too much of a coincidence to ignore.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, since you reported the body, where exactly did you find Dave, and did you see anyone else nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Dave's body in the Cafeteria, and Erin was the only other person in the room with me, so I'd like to know if she saw Bob and Alice return from Weapons at any point.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, I understand your concern, but I was in Weapons the entire time after leaving the Cafeteria, so I couldn't have been involved in what happened to Dave.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we need to carefully examine Bob's timeline, as he claims to have been in Weapons the whole time, but Alice and I both saw him in the Cafeteria earlier, which raises some serious questions about his credibility.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, since you found Dave's body with Erin, did you notice anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before you discovered him?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't see anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before I discovered Dave's body, which makes it difficult to pinpoint who else could have been involved.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, since you were focused on your task in the Cafeteria, can you confirm if anyone else entered or left after Alice and I moved to Weapons?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I didn't see anyone else enter or leave the Cafeteria after Bob and Alice went to Weapons, but Bob's inconsistent statements about his location are making me increasingly suspicious of his movements and potential involvement in Dave's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, did you notice any signs of struggle or anything unusual in the Cafeteria when you found Dave's body?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't notice any signs of struggle in the Cafeteria when I found Dave's body, which makes it even more puzzling how this happened without anyone seeing anything.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, can you confirm that I was in Weapons with you the entire time after leaving the Cafeteria, which might help clear up any doubts about my movements?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Bob's repeated attempts to have Alice confirm his location are a clear sign he's trying to construct an alibi, and we should be very skeptical of his constantly shifting narrative about where he was during Dave's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, since you were in the Cafeteria when Charlie found Dave's body, can you clarify if you saw anyone else enter or leave the room during that time?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you clarify if Bob was with you the entire time in Weapons, or did he have any opportunity to leave unnoticed, as his timeline seems inconsistent with Erin's observations?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, can you confirm that I was with

then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was working on the coffee maker in the Cafeteria and noticed Alice and Bob seemed to be moving suspiciously towards Weapons earlier, which struck me as a bit odd.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Dave, and Bob, completing tasks, and then moved to Weapons to clear asteroids, where Bob was fixing wiring, so I didn't see anything suspicious from him.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I haven't seen Bob much myself, so maybe we should hear from him about his movements to clear up any doubts.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Alice, and Dave, completing the trash task, and then moved to Weapons to fix wiring, where I saw Alice clearing asteroids, so nothing seemed suspicious to me.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm really concerned about Dave's death, and while I was focused on my task in the Cafeteria, I can't help but notice that Bob and Alice were both in Weapons together right before this happened, which seems like too much of a coincidence to ignore.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, since you reported the body, where exactly did you find Dave, and did you see anyone else nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Dave's body in the Cafeteria, and Erin was the only other person in the room with me, so I'd like to know if she saw Bob and Alice return from Weapons at any point.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, I understand your concern, but I was in Weapons the entire time after leaving the Cafeteria, so I couldn't have been involved in what happened to Dave.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we need to carefully examine Bob's timeline, as he claims to have been in Weapons the whole time, but Alice and I both saw him in the Cafeteria earlier, which raises some serious questions about his credibility.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, since you found Dave's body with Erin, did you notice anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before you discovered him?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't see anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before I discovered Dave's body, which makes it difficult to pinpoint who else could have been involved.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, since you were focused on your task in the Cafeteria, can you confirm if anyone else entered or left after Alice and I moved to Weapons?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I didn't see anyone else enter or leave the Cafeteria after Bob and Alice went to Weapons, but Bob's inconsistent statements about his location are making me increasingly suspicious of his movements and potential involvement in Dave's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, did you notice any signs of struggle or anything unusual in the Cafeteria when you found Dave's body?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't notice any signs of struggle in the Cafeteria when I found Dave's body, which makes it even more puzzling how this happened without anyone seeing anything.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, can you confirm that I was in Weapons with you the entire time after leaving the Cafeteria, which might help clear up any doubts about my movements?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Bob's repeated attempts to have Alice confirm his location are a clear sign he's trying to construct an alibi, and we should be very skeptical of his constantly shifting narrative about where he was during Dave's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, since you were in the Cafeteria when Charlie found Dave's body, can you clarify if you saw anyone else enter or leave the room during that time?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you clarify if Bob was with you the entire time in Weapons, or did he have any opportunity to leave unnoticed, as his timeline seems inconsistent with Erin's observations?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, can you confirm that I was with you in Weapons the entire time, which would help clarify my timeline for everyone?\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 9\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous

then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was working on the coffee maker in the Cafeteria and noticed Alice and Bob seemed to be moving suspiciously towards Weapons earlier, which struck me as a bit odd.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Dave, and Bob, completing tasks, and then moved to Weapons to clear asteroids, where Bob was fixing wiring, so I didn't see anything suspicious from him.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I haven't seen Bob much myself, so maybe we should hear from him about his movements to clear up any doubts.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Alice, and Dave, completing the trash task, and then moved to Weapons to fix wiring, where I saw Alice clearing asteroids, so nothing seemed suspicious to me.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm really concerned about Dave's death, and while I was focused on my task in the Cafeteria, I can't help but notice that Bob and Alice were both in Weapons together right before this happened, which seems like too much of a coincidence to ignore.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, since you reported the body, where exactly did you find Dave, and did you see anyone else nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Dave's body in the Cafeteria, and Erin was the only other person in the room with me, so I'd like to know if she saw Bob and Alice return from Weapons at any point.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, I understand your concern, but I was in Weapons the entire time after leaving the Cafeteria, so I couldn't have been involved in what happened to Dave.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we need to carefully examine Bob's timeline, as he claims to have been in Weapons the whole time, but Alice and I both saw him in the Cafeteria earlier, which raises some serious questions about his credibility.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, since you found Dave's body with Erin, did you notice anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before you discovered him?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't see anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before I discovered Dave's body, which makes it difficult to pinpoint who else could have been involved.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, since you were focused on your task in the Cafeteria, can you confirm if anyone else entered or left after Alice and I moved to Weapons?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I didn't see anyone else enter or leave the Cafeteria after Bob and Alice went to Weapons, but Bob's inconsistent statements about his location are making me increasingly suspicious of his movements and potential involvement in Dave's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie, did you notice any signs of struggle or anything unusual in the Cafeteria when you found Dave's body?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't notice any signs of struggle in the Cafeteria when I found Dave's body, which makes it even more puzzling how this happened without anyone seeing anything.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, can you confirm that I was in Weapons with you the entire time after leaving the Cafeteria, which might help clear up any doubts about my movements?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Bob's repeated attempts to have Alice confirm his location are a clear sign he's trying to construct an alibi, and we should be very skeptical of his constantly shifting narrative about where he was during Dave's murder.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, since you were in the Cafeteria when Charlie found Dave's body, can you clarify if you saw anyone else enter or leave the room during that time?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, can you clarify if Bob was with you the entire time in Weapons, or did he have any opportunity to leave unnoticed, as his timeline seems inconsistent with Erin's observations?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, can you confirm that I was with you in Weapons the entire time, which would help clarify my timeline for everyone?\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 9\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous

Pretend to do the \"Calibrate targeting system\" task in Weapons to maintain the appearance of being a normal crewmate and avoid suspicion.\n\n2. Move to Navigation, since Alice was recently seen moving there, which provides an opportunity to potentially isolate a crewmate and create an elimination opportunity.\n\n3.

Keep a close watch for any moments where Alice or other remaining crewmates might be alone and vulnerable, preparing to eliminate them when the opportunity presents itself.\n\nThe key strategy is to continue maintaining a low profile, move strategically between locations, and look for chances to reduce the number of crewmates while avoiding detection as an impostor.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

Bob seemed to be moving suspiciously towards Weapons earlier, which struck me as a bit odd.\n[Alice]: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Dave, and Bob, completing tasks, and then moved to Weapons to clear asteroids, where Bob was fixing wiring, so I didn't see anything suspicious from him.\n[Charlie]: I haven't seen Bob much myself, so maybe we should hear from him about his movements to clear up any doubts.\n[Bob]: I was in the Cafeteria with Erin, Alice, and Dave, completing the trash task, and then moved to Weapons to fix wiring, where I saw Alice clearing asteroids, so nothing seemed suspicious to me.\n[Erin]: I'm really concerned about Dave's death, and while I was focused on my task in the Cafeteria, I can't help but notice that Bob and Alice were both in Weapons together right before this happened, which seems like too much of a coincidence to ignore.\n[Alice]: Charlie, since you reported the body, where exactly did you find Dave, and did you see anyone else nearby?\n[Charlie]: I found Dave's body in the Cafeteria, and Erin was the only other person in the room with me, so I'd like to know if she saw Bob and Alice return from Weapons at any point.\n[Bob]: Erin, I understand your concern, but I was in Weapons the entire time after leaving the Cafeteria, so I couldn't have been involved in what happened to Dave.\n[Erin]: I think we need to carefully examine Bob's timeline, as he claims to have been in Weapons the whole time, but Alice and I both saw him in the Cafeteria earlier, which raises some serious questions about his credibility.\n[Alice]: Charlie, since you found Dave's body with Erin, did you notice anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before you discovered him?\n[Charlie]: I didn't see anyone else entering or leaving the Cafeteria before I discovered Dave's body, which makes it difficult to pinpoint who else could have been involved.\n[Bob]: Erin, since you were focused on your task in the Cafeteria, can you confirm if anyone else entered or left after Alice and I moved to Weapons?\n[Erin]: I didn't see anyone else enter or leave the Cafeteria after Bob and Alice went to Weapons, but Bob's inconsistent statements about his location are making me increasingly suspicious of his movements and potential involvement in Dave's death.\n[Alice]: Charlie, did you notice any signs of struggle or anything unusual in the Cafeteria when you found Dave's body?\n[Charlie]: I didn't notice any signs of struggle in the Cafeteria when I found Dave's body, which makes it even more puzzling how this happened without anyone seeing anything.\n[Bob]: Alice, can you confirm that I was in Weapons with you the entire time after leaving the Cafeteria, which might help clear up any doubts about my movements?\n[Erin]: I think Bob's repeated attempts to have Alice confirm his location are a clear sign he's trying to construct an alibi, and we should be very skeptical of his constantly shifting narrative about where he was during Dave's murder.\n[Alice]: Erin, since you were in the Cafeteria when Charlie found Dave's body, can you clarify if you saw anyone else enter or leave the room during that time?\n[Charlie]: Alice, can you clarify if Bob was with you the entire time in Weapons, or did he have any opportunity to leave unnoticed, as his timeline seems inconsistent with Erin's observations?\n[Bob]: Alice,
