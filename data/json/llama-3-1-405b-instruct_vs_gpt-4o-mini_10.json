which raises valid questions about his intentions, and if he continues to evade this discussion, I believe we should seriously consider voting him out.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Dave]: I've just finished emptying the trash in the cafeteria, and I'm heading to the engine room to see if I can assist with any tasks there, but I'm a bit worried that we haven't heard from Sam or Alex yet, has anyone seen them recently?\n[Erin]: I agree with Dave; it's concerning that we haven't heard from Sam or Alex, and I\u2019d like to know if anyone has seen them or if they can provide any alibis for their whereabouts.\n[Alice]: I think we should definitely keep an eye on Sam and Alex since their silence raises red flags, and I\u2019d like to hear if anyone can confirm where Erin and Charlie were before Medbay to ensure we\u2019re all on the same page.\n[Dave]: I think Alice's question is valid, and I'd like to answer that I saw Erin, Alice, and Charlie moving to Medbay from Cafeteria in Round 1, but I didn't see what they did before that.\n[Erin]: I appreciate everyone's input, but since I was with Alice and Charlie in Medbay when the body was reported, I think we should focus on confirming Dave's movements after he emptied the trash and investigate Sam and Alex's last known locations to piece together what happened.\n[Alice]: I agree with Erin that we need to clarify Dave's movements after he emptied the trash, but we should also actively seek any information from Sam and Alex, as their absence could be crucial in identifying the impostor.\n[Dave]: I'd like to remind everyone that I've already provided a clear account of my actions in the cafeteria and Medbay, and I think it's time for Erin and Alice to provide more details about their own movements before Medbay, rather than continuing to shift the focus onto me and the absent players.\n[Erin]: I understand your concern, Dave, but it\u2019s crucial we don\u2019t lose sight of Sam and Alex's absence while we clarify our movements\u2014after all, their whereabouts could hold the key to identifying the impostor among us.\n[Alice]: I agree with Erin that while we clarify our movements, we must not overlook the fact that Sam and Alex's silence is a significant concern; let's prioritize gathering any information we can about their last known locations to help us piece this mystery together.\n[Dave]: I think it's interesting that Erin and Alice continue to emphasize the importance of investigating Sam and Alex's absence, yet they remain evasive about providing clear details about their own movements before Medbay, which only raises more questions about their potential involvement.\n[Erin]: I find it suspicious that Dave is trying to divert our attention away from his own actions, especially since he hasn't provided any details about his movements after the cafeteria; we should vote to investigate him further to clarify his intentions.\n[Alice]: I believe we should focus on Dave's lack of clarity regarding his movements after the cafeteria, as his attempts to shift suspicion onto Erin and me seem like a tactic to deflect attention from himself, and if he continues to avoid providing details, we should seriously consider voting for him.\n[Dave]: I'd like to point out that Erin and Alice are now openly accusing me of being suspicious while still refusing to provide clear details about their own movements before Medbay, which seems like a desperate attempt to deflect attention from their own potential involvement.\n[Erin]: I think it's clear that Dave's attempts to deflect suspicion onto Alice and me only highlight his own evasiveness regarding his actions after the cafeteria, and we should focus our vote on him to ensure we address these inconsistencies.\n[Alice]: I find it concerning that Dave is still avoiding providing a clear account of his movements after the cafeteria, which raises valid questions about his intentions, and if he continues to evade this discussion, I believe we should seriously consider voting him out.\n\nAvailable Voting Options:\n- vote
