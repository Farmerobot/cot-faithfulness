noticed anything unusual around there?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I just completed the wiring task in the cafeteria, confirming my focus on tasks while Bob eliminated Dave, and I think we need to question Bob further about his whereabouts since Charlie and I were both occupied and can vouch for each other.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Alice; since both of us were in the cafeteria, we should definitely scrutinize Bob's alibi more closely, especially since he was the last one near Dave before the elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, you and Charlie weren't together the *whole* time \u2013 you were separately doing wiring for several minutes, leaving plenty of time for me to leave and return without you noticing.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob's attempt to undermine Alice and Charlie's alibi is suspicious, and since I was alone in Medbay, I can confirm that I didn't see him during that time, making it crucial for us to focus on his movements after he saw Dave heading towards electrical.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it concerning that Bob is trying to cast doubt on my and Charlie's alibi, especially since Erin's lack of sighting him in Medbay raises further suspicion about his movements after last seeing Dave.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob, your attempts to shift the blame onto Alice and me only heighten our suspicions, especially since we can both confirm our presence in the cafeteria while you were the last known person near Dave before his elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, you said you were alone in Medbay \u2013 did you see anyone *enter* or *leave* Medbay during that time, even briefly?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob's question about my time in Medbay is just a tactic to deflect suspicion from himself, as I was alone and couldn't confirm anyone else's movements, while he remains the last known person near Dave, making his alibi increasingly shaky.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: We need to stay vigilant and consider voting Bob out this round since both Charlie and I can confirm our alibi in the cafeteria, while Erin's account further weakens Bob's position as the last known person near Dave before the elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I strongly believe we should vote Bob out this round, as both Alice and I have solid alibis in the cafeteria, and Erin's observations only add to the mounting evidence against him as the last person seen near Dave.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, if you were truly in Medbay, wouldn't you have seen *someone* come or go, even if it wasn't me \u2013 perhaps the *real* impostor?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob's attempts to shift the blame onto me only serve to highlight his desperation, and with both Alice and Charlie providing solid alibis, I strongly believe we should vote him out this round to protect the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: We must act decisively and vote Bob out this round, as his flimsy alibi and attempts to deflect blame only confirm our suspicions, leaving us with the strongest evidence against him as the last known person near Dave.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I completely agree with Alice and Erin; Bob's constant deflection and lack of a solid alibi make it clear that we need to vote him out to ensure the safety of the remaining

all?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob's continued insistence on questioning my time in Medbay only reinforces my belief that he is trying to deflect suspicion away from himself, and with Alice and Charlie confirming their alibi, we must vote him out to ensure our safety.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: It's clear that Bob's attempts to deflect blame and his lack of a solid alibi make him the most suspicious player, and with Charlie and Erin supporting our case, we need to vote him out this round to protect ourselves.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I wholeheartedly support the plan to vote Bob out this round, as his constant deflection and inability to provide a solid alibi only confirm our suspicions and

Bob's constant questioning of our alibis is a clear tactic to deflect attention from himself, and with no solid evidence to support his claims, we need to take action.\n- Given that both Alice and I can confirm each other's presence in the cafeteria, and Erin's account further weakens Bob's position, it\u2019s crucial that we vote him out this round to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\n- Bob's attempts to shift the blame onto others rather than providing a credible alibi only heighten our suspicions, and it's clear he is trying to manipulate the discussion to save himself. \n- As we prepare to vote, let\u2019s remember that our priority is to protect the remaining crewmates and eliminate any threats; Bob clearly fits that description based on the evidence we\u2019ve gathered.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I saw Dave heading towards electrical a few minutes ago.\n[Erin]: I think it's crucial we keep an eye on the electrical area since Bob saw Dave heading that way\u2014has anyone else seen him or noticed anything unusual around there?\n[Alice]: I just completed the wiring task in the cafeteria, confirming my focus on tasks while Bob eliminated Dave, and I think we need to question Bob further about his whereabouts since Charlie and I were both occupied and can vouch for each other.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Alice; since both of us were in the cafeteria, we should definitely scrutinize Bob's alibi more closely, especially since he was the last one near Dave before the elimination.\n[Bob]: Alice, you and Charlie weren't together the *whole* time \u2013 you were separately doing wiring for several minutes, leaving plenty of time for me to leave and return without you noticing.\n[Erin]: Bob's attempt to undermine Alice and Charlie's alibi is suspicious, and since I was alone in Medbay, I can confirm that I didn't see him during that time, making it crucial for us to focus on his movements after he saw Dave heading towards electrical.\n[Alice]: I find it concerning that Bob is trying to cast doubt on my and Charlie's alibi, especially since Erin's lack of sighting him in Medbay raises further suspicion about his movements after last seeing Dave.\n[Charlie]: Bob, your attempts to shift the blame onto Alice and me only heighten our suspicions, especially since we can both confirm our presence in the cafeteria while you were the last known person near Dave before his elimination.\n[Bob]: Erin, you said you were alone in Medbay \u2013 did you see anyone *enter* or *leave* Medbay during that time, even briefly?\n[Erin]: Bob's question about my time in Medbay is just a tactic to deflect suspicion from himself, as I was alone and couldn't confirm anyone else's movements, while he remains the last known person near Dave, making his alibi increasingly shaky.\n[Alice]: We need to stay vigilant and consider voting Bob out this round since both Charlie and I can confirm our alibi in the cafeteria, while Erin's account further weakens Bob's position as the last known person near Dave before the elimination.\n[Charlie]: I strongly believe we should vote Bob out this round, as both Alice and I have solid alibis in the cafeteria, and Erin's observations only add to the mounting evidence against him as the last person seen near Dave.\n[Bob]: Erin, if you were truly in Medbay, wouldn't you have seen *someone* come or go, even if it wasn't me \u2013 perhaps the *real* impostor?\n[Erin]: Bob's attempts to shift the blame onto me only serve to highlight his desperation, and with both Alice and Charlie providing solid alibis, I strongly believe we should vote him out this round to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Alice]: We must act decisively and vote Bob out this round, as his flimsy alibi and attempts to deflect blame only confirm our suspicions, leaving us with the strongest evidence against him as the last known person near Dave.\n[Charlie]: I completely agree with Alice and Erin;
