Alex either, but I did notice that the Engine Room's task log seems to be missing some entries, which might be a sign that someone was trying to cover their tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I've been trying to access the Engine Room's task log, but it's locked, which is unusual since I've had access to it before, and I think we should investigate further to see if we can find any clues about Alex's disappearance and the missing task log entries.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I've just accessed the Engine Room's task log and found a suspicious entry that seems to be a fake task, which might be a red flag for an impostor trying to cover their tracks, and I think we should discuss this further with the group to see if we can identify any potential impostors.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we should definitely investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to share more about the locked Engine Room's task log, as it might hold some crucial information about Alex's disappearance and the impostor's identity.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given the recent discussion about the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be linked to a similar task that was completed in the Cafeteria, which makes me wonder if the impostor might be trying to create a false trail by making it seem like the task was completed in multiple locations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that we should investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be linked to a similar task that was completed in the Cafeteria, which makes me wonder if the impostor might be trying to create a false trail by making it seem like the task was completed in multiple locations, and I think we should also discuss the fact that I was alone in Admin for a long time, and I didn't see anyone else in the room, which might be a sign that someone was trying to avoid being seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we should also review the task log and look for any other suspicious entries or patterns that might indicate the presence of an impostor, and I'd like to propose that we create a timeline of all the task completions and eliminations to see if we can identify any inconsistencies or anomalies that might help us identify the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree that we should investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be linked to a similar task that was completed in the Cafeteria, which makes me wonder if the impostor might be trying to create a false trail by making it seem like the task was completed in multiple locations, and I think we should also discuss the fact that I was in the Cafeteria around the same time as Erin and didn't see anyone suspicious, but I did notice that the task log for the Cafeteria seems to be up to date, which might be a sign that the impostor is trying to cover their tracks in multiple locations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to add that given the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, combined with the fact that Erin was in the Cafeteria around the same time as me and didn't see anyone suspicious, it's possible that the impostor is trying to create a false trail by making it seem like they were in multiple locations at once, and I think we should investigate Erin's alibi further to see if she can provide any additional information that might help us identify the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should create a timeline of all the task completions and eliminations, including the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, to see if we can identify any inconsistencies or anomalies that might help us identify the impostor, and I'd like to propose that we also investigate Erin's alibi further to see if she can provide any additional information that might help us identify the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given the recent discussion about the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, and considering Erin's alibi seems suspicious, I'd like to suggest that we create a detailed timeline of all the task completions and eliminations, including the suspicious task log entry and Erin's whereabouts during that time, to help us identify any inconsistencies or anomalies that might help us identify the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss,

investigation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we've been focusing too much on Erin's alibi, and it's time for us to

sign that someone was trying to cover their tracks.\n[Charlie]: I've been trying to access the Engine Room's task log, but it's locked, which is unusual since I've had access to it before, and I think we should investigate further to see if we can find any clues about Alex's disappearance and the missing task log entries.\n[Bob]: I've just accessed the Engine Room's task log and found a suspicious entry that seems to be a fake task, which might be a red flag for an impostor trying to cover their tracks, and I think we should discuss this further with the group to see if we can identify any potential impostors.\n[Erin]: I think we should definitely investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to share more about the locked Engine Room's task log, as it might hold some crucial information about Alex's disappearance and the impostor's identity.\n[Dave]: Given the recent discussion about the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be linked to a similar task that was completed in the Cafeteria, which makes me wonder if the impostor might be trying to create a false trail by making it seem like the task was completed in multiple locations.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Erin and

multiple locations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that we should investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be linked to a similar task that was completed in the Cafeteria, which makes me wonder if the impostor might be trying to

Alex's disappearance and the missing task log entries.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I've just accessed the Engine Room's task log and found a suspicious entry that seems to be a fake task, which might be a red flag for an impostor trying to cover their tracks, and I think we should discuss this further with the group to see if we can identify any potential impostors.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4

multiple locations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that we should investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be linked to a similar task that was completed in the Cafeteria, which makes me wonder if the impostor might be trying to create a false trail by making it seem like the task was completed in multiple locations, and I think we should also discuss the fact that I was alone in Admin for a long time, and I didn't see anyone else in the room, which might be a sign that someone was trying to avoid being seen.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we should also review the task log and look for any other suspicious entries or

also discuss the fact that I was in the Cafeteria around the same time as Erin and didn't see anyone suspicious, but I did notice that the task log for the Cafeteria seems to be up to date, which

I propose that we ask Bob to share more about the suspicious task log entry and see if we can find any other inconsistencies in the task log.\n- I've been thinking about the task log and the missing entries, and I wonder if it's possible that an impostor was trying to create a false trail to mislead us. If that's the case, we need to be vigilant and keep a close eye on each other's actions to prevent any further manipulation.\n- I'd like to ask Erin if she's noticed anything unusual in the Cafeteria, given her recent message about grabbing a snack. Perhaps she might have seen something that could help us in our investigation.\n- I think it's crucial that we discuss the recent report of a dead body and the implications it might have for our game.

deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nHere are some discussion points as Dave:\n\n- I think we should focus on creating a detailed timeline of all the task completions and eliminations, including the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and Erin's whereabouts during that time, to help us identify any inconsistencies or anomalies that might help us identify the impostor.\n- Given the recent discussion about the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, combined with the fact that Erin was in the Cafeteria around the same time as me and didn't see anyone suspicious, it's possible that the impostor is trying to create a false trail by making it seem like they were in multiple locations at once, and I think we should investigate Erin's alibi further to see if she can provide any additional information that might help us identify the impostor.\n- I'd like to add that we should also investigate Charlie's alibi for the time they were alone in Admin, as it might be a crucial piece of evidence in our investigation, and considering Charlie's suspicious activities in the Admin room during the time they were alone, I think we should discuss the fact that Charlie seems to have had access to the Engine Room's task log despite it being locked, and that they never mentioned it during the group's initial discussion, which raises some red flags for me.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I'm just grabbing a quick snack in the Cafeteria, I didn't see anyone suspicious around, but I did notice that Alex hasn't been seen for a while, wonder if they're okay.\n[Dave]: I've been in the Library and the Engine Room, and I haven't seen Alex either, but I did notice that the Engine Room's task log seems to be missing some entries, which might be a sign that someone was trying to cover their tracks.\n[Charlie]: I've been trying to access the Engine Room's task log, but it's locked, which is unusual since I've had access to it before, and I think we should investigate further to see if we can find any clues about Alex's disappearance and the missing task log entries.\n[Bob]: I've just accessed the Engine Room's task log and found a suspicious entry that seems to be a fake task, which might be a red flag for an impostor trying to cover their tracks, and I think we should discuss this further with the group to see if we can identify any potential impostors.\n[Erin]: I think we should definitely investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to share more about the locked Engine Room's task log, as it might hold some crucial information about Alex's disappearance and the impostor's identity.\n[Dave]: Given the recent discussion about the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be linked to a similar task that was completed in the Cafeteria, which makes me wonder if the impostor might be trying to create a false trail by making it seem like the task was completed in multiple locations.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that we should investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be linked to a similar task that was completed in the Cafeteria, which makes me wonder if the impostor might be trying to create a false trail by making it seem like the task was completed in multiple locations, and I think we should also discuss the fact that I was alone in Admin for a long time, and I didn't see anyone else in the room, which might be a sign that someone was trying to avoid being seen.\n[Bob]: I think we should also review the task log and look for any other suspicious entries or patterns that might indicate the presence of an impostor, and I'd like to propose that we create a timeline of all the task completions and eliminations to see if we can identify any inconsistencies or anomalies that might help us identify

might be a red flag for an impostor trying to cover their tracks, and I think we should discuss this further with the group to see if we can identify any potential impostors.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we should definitely investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to share more about the locked

anomalies that might help us identify the impostor.\n- Given the recent discussion about the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, and considering Erin's alibi seems suspicious, I'd like to suggest that we also investigate Charlie's alibi for the time they were alone in Admin and Dave's alibi for the time they were in the Library and the Engine Room, as both of these alibis seem suspicious and might be crucial pieces of evidence in our investigation.\n- I'd like to address Erin's concerns about my activities in the Admin room during the time I was alone, and I'd like to clarify that I did not have access to the Engine Room's task log despite it being locked, and I did not mention it during the group's initial discussion because I was not aware of it at the time, and I'd like to propose that we focus on gathering more information and creating a detailed timeline to help us identify the impostor.\n- I think we should also investigate the fact that I was alone in Admin for a long time, and I didn't see anyone else in the room, which might be a sign that someone was trying to avoid being seen, and I'd like to propose that we discuss this further and see if we can find any other clues that might help us identify the impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I'm just grabbing a quick snack in the Cafeteria, I didn't see anyone suspicious around, but I did notice that Alex hasn't been seen for a while, wonder if they're okay.\n[Dave]: I've been in the Library and the Engine Room, and I haven't seen Alex either, but I did notice that the Engine Room's task log seems to be missing some entries, which might be a sign that someone was trying to cover their tracks.\n[Charlie]: I've been trying to access the Engine Room's task log, but it's locked, which is unusual since I've had access to it before, and I think we should investigate further to see if we can find any clues about Alex's disappearance and the missing task log entries.\n[Bob]: I've just accessed the Engine Room's task log and found a suspicious entry that seems to be a fake task, which might be a red flag for an impostor trying to cover their tracks, and I think we should discuss this further with the group to see if we can identify any potential impostors.\n[Erin]: I think we should definitely investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to share more about the locked Engine Room's task log, as it might hold some crucial information about Alex's disappearance and the impostor's identity.\n[Dave]: Given the recent discussion about the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be linked to a similar task that was completed in the Cafeteria, which makes me wonder if the impostor might be trying to create a false trail by making it seem like the task was completed in multiple locations.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that we should investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd

I'd like to add that given the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, combined with the fact that Erin was in the Cafeteria around the same time as me and didn't see anyone suspicious, it's possible that the impostor is trying to create a false trail by making it seem like they were in multiple locations at once, and I think we should investigate Erin's alibi

that Alex hasn't been seen for a while, wonder if they're okay.\n[Dave]: I've been in the Library and the Engine Room, and I haven't seen Alex either, but I did notice that the Engine Room's task log seems to be missing some entries, which might be a sign that someone was trying to cover their tracks.\n[Charlie]: I've been trying to access the Engine Room's task log, but it's locked, which is unusual since I've had access to it before, and I think we should investigate further to see if we can find any clues about Alex's disappearance and the missing task log entries.\n[Bob]: I've just accessed the Engine Room's task log and found a suspicious entry that seems to be a fake task, which might be a red flag for an impostor trying to cover their tracks, and I think we should discuss this further with the group to see if we can identify any potential impostors.\n[Erin]: I think we should definitely investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to share more about the locked Engine Room's task log, as it might hold some crucial information about Alex's disappearance and the impostor's identity.\n[Dave]: Given the recent discussion about the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be linked to a similar task that was completed in the Cafeteria, which makes me wonder if the impostor might be trying to create a false trail by making it seem like the task was completed in multiple locations.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that we should investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be linked to a similar task that was completed in the Cafeteria, which makes me wonder if the impostor might be trying to create a false trail by making it seem like the task was completed in multiple locations, and I think we should also discuss the fact that I was alone in Admin for a long time, and I didn't see anyone else in the room, which might be a sign that someone was trying to avoid being seen.\n[Bob]: I think we should also review the task log and look for any other suspicious entries or patterns that might indicate the presence of an impostor, and I'd like to propose that we create a timeline of all the task completions and eliminations to see if we can identify any inconsistencies or anomalies that might help us identify the impostor.\n[Erin]: I agree that we should investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to add that I've been reviewing

but I did notice that the task log for the Cafeteria seems to be up to date, which might be a sign that the impostor is trying to cover their tracks in multiple locations.\n[Dave]: I'd like to add that given the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, combined with the fact that Erin was in the Cafeteria around the same time as me and didn't see anyone suspicious, it's possible that the impostor is trying to create a false trail by making it seem like they were in multiple locations at once, and I think we should investigate Erin's alibi further to see if she can provide any additional information that might help us identify the impostor.\n[Charlie]: I think we should create a timeline of all the task completions and eliminations, including the suspicious

I think we should try to access the task log and see if we can find any clues about Alex's disappearance and the missing task log entries.\n\nHere's my plan:\n\n1. **Move to location Engine Room**: I'll move to the Engine Room to try to access the task log and investigate further.\n2. **Investigate the task log**: I'll try to access the task log and see if I can find any clues about Alex's disappearance and the missing task log entries.\n3. **Discuss with Erin and Dave**: I'll discuss my findings with Erin and Dave and see if we can come up with a plan to investigate further.\n\nI'll move to the Engine Room and try to access the task log.", "I've just accessed the Engine Room's task log and found a suspicious entry that seems to be a fake task, which might be a red flag for an impostor trying to cover their tracks, and I think we should discuss this further with the group to see if we can identify any potential impostors.", "- We should focus on investigating the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further to identify potential impostors\n- Charlie, can you share more about the locked Engine Room's task log and how you accessed it before, as it might hold crucial information about Alex's disappearance and the impostor's identity\n- I propose we discuss the possibility of an impostor trying to create a false trail by making it seem like tasks were completed in multiple locations, and we should also consider the fact that Charlie was alone in Admin for a long time, which might be a sign that someone was trying to avoid being seen\n- We should also review the task log and look for any other suspicious entries or patterns that might indicate the presence of an impostor\n- I think we should also discuss the fact that Erin eliminated Alice, and we should investigate further to see if there's any connection between Alice's death and the suspicious task log entry or the missing task log entries.", "I think we should also review the task log and look for any other suspicious entries or patterns that might indicate the presence of an impostor, and I'd like to propose that we create a timeline of all the task completions and eliminations to see if we can identify any inconsistencies or anomalies that might help us identify the impostor.", "- Erin's alibi seems suspicious, and we should investigate further to see if she can provide any additional information that might help us identify the impostor.\n- The fact that Erin was in the Cafeteria around the same time as Dave and didn't see anyone suspicious, but the task log for the Cafeteria seems to be up to date, raises some red flags, and we should discuss this further with the group.\n- Dave's suggestion to investigate Erin's alibi further is a good idea, and I'd like to add that we should also review the task log and look for any other suspicious entries or patterns that might indicate the presence of an impostor.\n- Creating a timeline of all the task completions and eliminations, including the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, will help us identify any inconsistencies or anomalies that might help us identify the

should also review the task log and look for any other suspicious entries or patterns that might indicate the presence of an impostor\n- I think we should also discuss the fact that Erin eliminated

haven't seen Alex either, but I did notice that the Engine Room's task log seems to be missing some entries, which might be a sign that someone was trying to cover their tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I've been trying to access the Engine Room's task log, but it's locked, which is unusual since I've had access to it before, and I think we should investigate further to see if we can find any clues about Alex's disappearance and the missing task log entries.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I've just accessed the Engine Room's task log and found a suspicious entry that seems to be a fake task, which might be a red flag for an impostor trying to cover their tracks, and I think we should discuss this further with the group to see if we can identify any potential impostors.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we should definitely investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to share more about the locked Engine Room's task log, as it might hold some crucial information about Alex's disappearance and the impostor's identity.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given the recent discussion about the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log

that we should investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be linked to a similar task that was completed in the Cafeteria, which makes me wonder if the impostor might be trying to create a false trail by making it seem like the task was completed in multiple locations, and I think we should also discuss the fact that I was in the Cafeteria around the same time as Erin and didn't see anyone suspicious, but I did notice that the task log for the Cafeteria seems to be up to date, which might be a sign that the impostor is trying to cover their tracks in multiple locations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to add that given the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, combined with the fact that Erin was in the Cafeteria around the same time as me and didn't see anyone suspicious, it's possible that the impostor is trying to create a false trail by making it seem like they were in multiple locations at once, and I think we should investigate Erin's alibi further to see if she can provide any additional information that might help us identify the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should create a timeline of all the task completions and eliminations, including the suspicious task log

Moving to Medbay will allow Bob to reunite with other players and potentially access more tasks, information, or location-specific actions.\n2. **Join the Discussion**: Now that Bob has reached Medbay, it's essential to participate in the ongoing discussion with Erin, Dave, and Charlie. Reviewing past conversations and recent developments will help Bob stay informed about potential leads, suspicious actions, and task completions/eliminations.\n3. **Contribute to Timeline Creation**: Joining the discussion might also encourage Bob to contribute to the creation of a detailed timeline of all task completions and eliminations, as discussed in the chat messages. Focusing on inconsistencies and anomalies will aid in identifying potential impostors.\n4. **Access Available Tasks in Medbay**: Familiarize yourself with the tasks available in Medbay, and consider completing any tasks that are not already being worked on by the other players. This will help Bob make progress toward completing objectives and reducing the overall task list.\n\nBy following this plan, Bob will be able to stay in touch with other players, gather more information, contribute to the investigation, and make progress toward completing objectives in Medbay.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

[Charlie]: I've been trying to access the Engine Room's task log, but it's locked, which is unusual since I've had access to it before, and I think we should investigate further to see if we can find

Engine Room's task log and found a suspicious entry that seems to be a fake task, which might be a red flag for an impostor trying to cover their tracks, and I think we should discuss this further with the group to see if we can identify any potential impostors.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we should definitely investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to share more about the locked Engine Room's task log, as it might hold some crucial information about Alex's disappearance and the impostor's identity.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given the recent discussion about the suspicious task log entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be linked to a similar task that was completed in the Cafeteria, which makes me wonder if the impostor might be trying to create a false trail by making it seem like the task was completed in multiple locations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin and Dave that we should investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be linked to a similar task that was completed in the Cafeteria, which makes me wonder if the impostor might be trying to create a false trail by making it seem like the task was completed in multiple locations, and I think we should also discuss the fact that I was alone in Admin for a long

that we should investigate the suspicious task log entry and the missing task log entries further, and I'd like to add that I've been reviewing the task log and noticed that the fake task seems to be

locations, and I think we should also discuss the fact that I was in the Cafeteria around the same time as Erin and didn't see anyone suspicious, but I did notice that the task log for the Cafeteria

entry in the Engine Room and the missing entries, combined with the fact that Erin was in the Cafeteria around the same time as me and didn't see anyone suspicious, it's possible that the impostor is trying to create a false trail by making it seem like they were in multiple locations at once, and I think we should investigate Erin's alibi further to see if she can provide any additional

Here's the plan:\n\n1. **Wait in Medbay**: With Charlie banished, we need to assess the situation and determine if Erin is trustworthy. Waiting in Medbay will allow you to observe Erin's behavior and see if she attempts to complete any tasks or provides any suspicious information.\n2. **Investigate Erin's actions**: As Erin is the only other player in the room with you, observe her actions closely. If she tries to complete a task or moves to a different location, it may indicate that she's an impostor trying to blend in or gather information.\n3. **Move to location Upper Engine**: Since you're in Medbay, moving to the Upper Engine might provide new information or opportunities to complete tasks. It's also a location that hasn't been heavily discussed, which could give you a better understanding of the current situation.\n4. **Check catalyzer in lower engine**: If you move to the Upper Engine, consider checking the catalyzer in the lower engine to see if there are any suspicious task log entries or anomalies that might indicate the presence of an impostor.\n\nThis plan focuses on observing Erin's behavior, exploring new locations, and investigating potential impostors.
