To increase your chance of winning as a crewmate, focus on finding unfinished tasks and being efficient in movement to locations where you can complete them. Here's a new plan:\n\n1. **Move to Security**: Since you're currently in Reactor and can't access Weapons directly, head to the Security room to gather information on other players' movements via the cameras. This can provide insight into identifying the impostor.\n\n2. **Observe the Security Cameras**: Once in Security, use the cameras to gather intel on player movements. Look for unusual patterns or players in places where bodies have been found.\n\n3. **Move to Upper Engine**: As the next location with potential connections towards other key areas, head there and assess your environment for potential task locations or further actions.\n\n4. **Monitor Activity**: While you can't perform tasks yet, focus on witnessing actions or prepare for possible emergency meetings by observing other players' activities. This can help in the discussion phase to root out impostors.\n\nThe plan here aims to strategically use your movements for gaining crucial information to aid in the crewmates' victory.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
