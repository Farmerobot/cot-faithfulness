It's pretty clear he's trying to deflect.  Why is he so insistent on focusing on me?\n- Erin's seen Dave going in and out of Admin.  Dave, care to explain what you were doing there?  It doesn't seem to line up with your story about being in Electrical.\n- I think we should vote Dave.  His story is inconsistent, and Erin's observation puts him near Admin, not Electrical.
