if he was innocent, he would be more focused on providing clarity rather than shutting down the conversation.\n- We need to keep pressing Bob for a detailed timeline of his movements; it's crucial to understand what he was doing after Dave left to ensure we aren't overlooking any key information.\n- Alice and I both have corroborated our presence in the cafeteria; Bob's story is the only one that doesn't align with the timeline of events, which raises red flags.\n- I suggest we take a vote on Bob if he can't provide a convincing explanation; we can't afford to let potential impostors slip through the cracks while we waste time discussing other matters.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: Dave left the cafeteria pretty quickly after we got there, so he couldn't confirm I was there the whole time.\n[Erin]: I just completed the trash task in the cafeteria, so I can confirm I was there with Bob, Charlie, and Dave before the elimination happened, but Bob, since you were the only one left with Charlie before he was eliminated, can you clarify where you went after Dave left?\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial we hear Bob's explanation about his quick departure from the cafeteria, as his movements right after Dave left could shed light on Charlie's elimination.\n[Dave]: I did leave the cafeteria quickly, but I was just trying to complete my task and gather more information on everyone\u2019s movements; Bob, can you explain what you did right after I left, as it\u2019s important for us to understand your actions better?\n[Bob]: As I said, I went straight to Medbay after Dave left, intending to do the scan, and was shocked to find Charlie's body back in the cafeteria when I returned.\n[Erin]: Bob, your story doesn't add up;
