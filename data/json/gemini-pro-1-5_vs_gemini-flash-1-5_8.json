Let's focus on the inconsistencies in his story.\n-  Charlie's attempts to create doubt by questioning Bob and my proximity in Medbay are a clear tactic to deflect from his own suspicious behavior.\n- A united vote to eject Charlie is crucial to ensure the survival of the crew. His actions and lack of a credible alibi strongly suggest he is the imposter.\n- Let's not be swayed by Charlie's attempts to sow discord.  We have consistent accounts that place him at the scene of the crime.\n-  We need to prioritize eliminating the imposter to complete our tasks and win the game.
