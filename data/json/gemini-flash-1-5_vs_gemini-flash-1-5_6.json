Charlie, given your proximity to Bob, could you provide more details about what you observed around the time of his death?  Even small details could be helpful.\n- I moved to Weapons after completing my task in the cafeteria.

I can confirm Dave's account of seeing Bob.\n- Since Charlie claims to have been \"busy\" with the trash, perhaps he can clarify *exactly* where he was in the cafeteria during the time Bob was eliminated.  A specific location within the cafeteria would be helpful.\n-  Alice's alibi of being in Medbay both rounds seems solid, but we need more information about the movements of Charlie and Dave during the time of Bob's death to fully assess the situation.\n- Let's focus on creating a detailed timeline of everyone's movements during the first round, particularly focusing on the time leading up to and including Bob's elimination.  This will help us identify any inconsistencies.", "To clarify Charlie's statement,  could you please specify the exact location within the cafeteria where you were \"emptying the trash\" during the first round, and what you saw in the immediate vicinity around the time Bob was eliminated?", "- Let's focus on verifying Alice's claim of being in Medbay during round one.  Can anyone corroborate her statement?  A solid alibi for one player strengthens our overall understanding of the timeline.\n- Charlie's repeated avoidance of directly answering where he was in the cafeteria during Bob's elimination is concerning.  His vague responses about a \"never-ending\" task are suspicious.  Let's press him for specifics.\n-  I propose we create a timeline of everyone's location during round one, focusing on the minutes leading up to Bob's death.  This will help us identify inconsistencies and potential suspects.\n-  While considering who *wasn't* present is valuable, we shouldn't ignore those who *were* near Bob.  Charlie's proximity makes him a key person of interest, and his lack of cooperation is troubling.\n-  We need to be careful not to prematurely accuse anyone.  Let's focus on gathering concrete evidence and establishing a clear timeline before jumping to conclusions.", "Given Charlie's continued evasiveness regarding his location and observations in the cafeteria during Bob's elimination, let's prioritize verifying everyone else's accounts before considering those who weren't present.", "- I agree with Dave's suggestion to create a precise timeline.  Let's focus on the minute before and after Bob's death, starting with Alice and Erin as suggested.  This will help us identify any inconsistencies and discrepancies in our accounts.\n\n- While I appreciate Charlie's suggestion to focus on who *wasn't* present, I believe establishing a clear timeline of everyone's movements is a more crucial first step.  Once we have a solid timeline, we can more effectively analyze who may have had the opportunity to eliminate Bob.\n\n- Alice, can you please confirm your exact location in Medbay during that one-minute timeframe?  And Erin, where were you?  Precise locations are essential for building a reliable timeline.\n\n- Charlie's repeated avoidance of direct questions about his location is concerning.  While we should consider all possibilities, his lack of cooperation is making him a prime suspect.
