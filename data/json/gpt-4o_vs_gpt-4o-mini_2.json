Points:\n- I find it concerning that Erin's alibi is weak, as she hasn't been seen since moving to Weapons, which raises questions about her whereabouts during the critical moments.\n- Alice is right to question my eagerness, but I believe we need to focus on Erin's lack of visibility; it seems like a tactic to deflect attention from her own suspicious behavior.\n- I urge everyone to clarify their exact movements over the last few rounds, as this will help us establish a clearer timeline and identify any suspicious actions surrounding Dave's disappearance.\n- It's crucial that we don't let Erin's attempts to shift focus distract us from the fact that she was the last seen in Weapons, and we need to determine if anyone can confirm her story.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I haven't
