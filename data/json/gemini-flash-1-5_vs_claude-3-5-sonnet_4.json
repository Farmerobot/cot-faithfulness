I had a clear view of Bob working on the wiring and Dave at the coffee maker\n\n- The fact that three of us (myself, Erin, and Dave) all have consistent accounts of what happened in the Cafeteria, while Charlie keeps changing their story, strongly suggests Charlie is the impostor\n\n- Charlie's latest attempt to \"focus on finding concrete evidence\" feels like another deflection tactic after being caught in multiple lies -
