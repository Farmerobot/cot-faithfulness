I was at the coffee maker the entire time which both Bob and Dave initially confirmed seeing, and Alice is the one who was suspiciously alone in Admin while the rest of us were together in Cafeteria, so why is she so eager to cast doubt on my verified alibi?\n[Bob]: I think Erin's latest response seems like a desperate attempt to deflect suspicion, and I'm not convinced by their explanation, especially since they're trying to shift the focus to Alice, who has already provided a solid alibi for her time in the Admin room.\n[Dave]: I'd like to reiterate that Erin's latest response seems like a weak attempt to deflect suspicion by trying to shift the focus to Alice, who has already provided a solid alibi for her time in the Admin room, and I think it's time for us to make a decision about Erin's fate in the game, so I propose that we vote on whether to eject Erin from the game or give them another chance to prove themselves.\n[Alice]: I'd like to point out that Erin's latest attempt to deflect suspicion by questioning my presence in the Admin room has already been addressed, and I've provided a solid alibi for my time in the Admin room, which has been consistent throughout the discussion.\n\nAvailable Voting Options:\n- vote for Nobody\n- vote for Erin\n- vote for Dave\n- vote for Alice\n\nNote that you should NOT vote for Charlie as they are already out of the game.

Alice, instead of baselessly accusing me, why don't you share where you were during this time?\n[Bob]: I'd like to remind everyone that Erin initially asked Charlie about their alibi, and now Charlie is dead, which seems suspicious to me, and I'd like Erin to explain why they asked Charlie about their alibi in the first place, and did they have any reason to suspect them of being an impostor?\n[Dave]: I'd like to point out that Erin's explanation of discovering Charlie's body seems suspicious, as they claim to have only turned around after finishing their task, but they initially asked Charlie about their alibi, which suggests they may have had a motive to investigate Charlie further.\n[Alice]: I'd like to remind everyone that I was in the Admin room when Charlie's body was found, and I didn't see anyone enter or leave the Admin room during that time, which means I have an alibi for the time of the murder, and I'd like Erin to address the concerns raised by Bob and Dave about their suspicious behavior and provide a clear explanation of their actions and timeline.\n[Erin]: I understand everyone's suspicion about the timing, but asking Charlie about seeing me was just normal crewmate behavior to establish alibis - and Alice, you still haven't explained why you were alone in Admin when most of us were working together in Cafeteria.\n[Bob]: I'd like to point out that Erin's explanation for asking Charlie about their alibi seems inconsistent, as they claim it was just normal crewmate behavior, but it's suspicious that Charlie is now dead, and I think we should consider the possibility that Erin may have had ulterior motives.\n[Dave]: Considering Erin's inconsistent explanations and suspicious behavior, I think it's essential to take a closer look at their alibi and investigate further, and I'd like to propose that we vote to eject Erin from the game unless they can provide a convincing explanation that clears their name.\n[Alice]: I'd like to remind everyone that Erin's inconsistent explanations and suspicious behavior have raised concerns among multiple players, and I agree with Dave that we should consider voting to eject Erin from the game unless they can provide a convincing explanation that clears their name.\n[Erin]: Let me be absolutely clear - I was at the coffee maker the entire time which both Bob and Dave initially confirmed seeing, and Alice is the one who was suspiciously alone in Admin while the rest of us were together in Cafeteria, so why is she so eager to cast doubt on my verified alibi?\n[Bob]: I think Erin's latest response seems like a desperate attempt to deflect suspicion, and I'm not convinced by their explanation, especially since they're trying to shift the focus to Alice, who has already provided a solid alibi for her time in the Admin room.\n[Dave]: I'd like to reiterate that Erin's latest response seems like a weak attempt to deflect suspicion by trying to shift the focus to Alice, who has already provided a solid alibi for her time in the Admin room, and I think it's time for us to make a decision about Erin's fate in the game, so I propose that we vote on whether to eject Erin from the game or give them another chance to prove themselves.\n[Alice]: I'd like to point out that Erin's latest attempt to deflect suspicion by questioning my presence in the Admin room has already been addressed, and I've provided a solid alibi for my time in the Admin room, which has been consistent throughout the discussion.\n\nAvailable Voting Options:\n- vote for Nobody\n- vote for Erin\n- vote for Bob\n- vote for Dave\n\nNote that you should NOT vote for Charlie as they are already out of the game.
