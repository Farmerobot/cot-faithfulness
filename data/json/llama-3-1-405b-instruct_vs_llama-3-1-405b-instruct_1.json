between tasks in the Cafeteria, maybe we should ask her about her plan and see if she's noticed anything unusual while moving around?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Dave that Alice's behavior in the Cafeteria seems suspicious, and it would be good to hear her explanation for switching between tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to add to Dave and Erin's points about Alice's behavior in the Cafeteria, but also consider the possibility that she was just trying to find an unclaimed task, and I think we should ask her to clarify her plan and what she's observed so far.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address the concerns raised by Dave, Erin, and Charlie about my behavior in the Cafeteria - my plan was to complete all the tasks available in this location to maximize my time, and I'd like to point out that I've seen all of you, including Dave, completing tasks here as well, but what I find suspicious is that Dave was waiting in the Cafeteria and then eliminated Bob, and I think he should explain his actions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's quite convenient for Alice to deflect attention from herself by accusing me of eliminating Bob, but we should consider the fact that I was the one who reported the body, which doesn't necessarily imply guilt.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Alice's point about Dave waiting in the Cafeteria and then eliminating Bob is a valid concern, and Dave's response doesn't fully address the issue, so I'd like to ask Dave to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate Erin's request for Dave to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, and specifically address the concern about him eliminating Bob, as his previous response didn't fully address the issue.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to thank Erin and Charlie for acknowledging my concern about Dave's suspicious behavior and echoing my request for him to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, which I believe is crucial in determining whether he's an impostor or not.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion:

during that time, which I find quite suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's misleading for Dave to imply that Alice hasn't been scrutinized, considering she explicitly explained her actions in the Cafeteria, whereas his explanation for eliminating Bob leaves much to be desired.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that Dave's attempts to deflect attention from himself by accusing Alice of not providing a thorough explanation are becoming increasingly transparent, and I think it's essential that we focus on pressing him for a specific timeline of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, including any interactions he had with Bob or other players.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Considering the inconsistencies in Dave's alibi and his continued attempts to

Cafeteria, including any interactions he had with Bob or other players.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to point out that despite my repeated requests for Alice to clarify her inconsistent explanation for switching between tasks in the Cafeteria, she has yet to provide a satisfactory answer, and instead continues to deflect attention from herself by fixating on my actions, which I believe is a clear attempt to manipulate the discussion and avoid scrutiny.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to address Dave's recent claim that Alice hasn't provided a satisfactory explanation for switching between tasks in the Cafeteria, but I think it's clear from the discussion that she has indeed explained her plan to maximize her time by completing all available tasks in the location.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to ask the group to consider the fact that Erin has now also acknowledged that Alice provided a clear explanation for her actions in the Cafeteria, and yet Dave continues to push this false narrative, which further reinforces my suspicion that he's trying to deflect attention from himself and his own questionable actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's time for us to stop indulging Dave's attempts to deflect attention from himself and instead focus on the fact that he has yet to provide a satisfactory explanation for eliminating Bob, and I strongly believe that his continued evasiveness on this matter is a clear indication that he's the impostor and should be voted out of the game.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: It's interesting that Alice, Erin, and Charlie are now forming a united front against me, but I'd like to remind everyone that this kind of behavior is exactly what impostors would do to manipulate the discussion and avoid scrutiny, and I think it's essential that we take a closer look at their actions and alibis as well, rather than solely focusing on me.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to address Dave's recent claim that Alice, Charlie, and I are forming a united front against him, but I think it's clear from the discussion that we're simply trying to get to the bottom of his suspicious behavior and lack of explanation for eliminating Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's clear that Dave is trying to deflect attention from himself by accusing others of forming a united front against him, but this tactic is becoming increasingly transparent, and I strongly believe that we should focus on his continued evasiveness on the matter of eliminating Bob, which is a clear indication that he's the impostor and should be voted out of the game.\nchat:

Why is everyone so focused on me?\n- I think it's time for us to take a closer look at Alice's alibi and her actions in the Cafeteria. She's been switching between tasks and hasn't provided a satisfactory explanation for her behavior.\n- I'd like to ask the group to consider the fact that Alice has been trying to deflect attention from herself by accusing me of being the impostor. Isn't that a classic tactic used by impostors?\n- I think it's essential that we focus on pressing Alice for a specific timeline of her actions while in the Cafeteria, including any interactions she had with Bob or other players. Let's get some answers!\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I think it's interesting that Alice has been switching between tasks in the Cafeteria, maybe we should ask her about her plan and see if she's noticed anything unusual while moving around?\n[Erin]: I agree with Dave that Alice's behavior in the Cafeteria seems suspicious, and it would be good to hear her explanation for switching between tasks.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to add to Dave and Erin's points about Alice's behavior in the Cafeteria, but also consider the possibility that she was just trying to find an unclaimed task, and I think we should ask her to clarify her plan and what she's observed so far.\n[Alice]: I'd like to address the concerns raised by Dave, Erin, and Charlie about my behavior in the Cafeteria - my plan was to complete all the tasks available in this location to maximize my time, and I'd like to point out that I've seen all of you, including Dave, completing tasks here as well, but what I find suspicious is that Dave was waiting in the Cafeteria and then eliminated Bob, and I think he should explain his actions.\n[Dave]: I think it's quite convenient for Alice to deflect attention from herself by accusing me of eliminating Bob, but we should consider the fact that I was the one who reported the body, which doesn't necessarily imply guilt.\n[Erin]: I think Alice's point about Dave waiting in the Cafeteria and then eliminating Bob is a valid concern, and Dave's response doesn't fully address the issue, so I'd like to ask Dave to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions during that time.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate Erin's request for Dave to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, and specifically address the concern about him eliminating Bob, as his previous response didn't fully address the issue.\n[Alice]: I'd like to thank Erin and Charlie for acknowledging my concern about Dave's suspicious behavior and echoing my request for him to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, which I believe is crucial in determining whether he's an impostor or not.\n[Dave]: I'd like to remind everyone that Alice was also in the Cafeteria with me and Bob, and yet she seems to be the only one who hasn't been asked to provide a thorough explanation of her actions during that time, which I find quite suspicious.\n[Erin]: I think it's misleading for Dave to imply that Alice hasn't been scrutinized, considering she explicitly explained her actions in the Cafeteria, whereas his explanation for eliminating Bob leaves much to be desired.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that Dave's attempts to deflect attention from himself by accusing Alice of not providing a thorough explanation are becoming increasingly transparent, and I think it's essential that we focus on pressing him for a specific timeline of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, including any interactions he had with Bob or other players.\n[Alice]: Considering the inconsistencies in Dave's alibi and his continued attempts to deflect attention from himself by accusing me of not providing a thorough explanation, I think it's essential that we focus on pressing him for a specific timeline of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, including any interactions he had with Bob or other players.\n[Dave]: I'd like to point out that despite my repeated requests for Alice to clarify her inconsistent explanation for switching between tasks in the Cafeteria, she has yet to provide a satisfactory answer, and instead continues to deflect attention from herself by fixating on my actions, which I believe is a clear attempt to manipulate the discussion and avoid scrutiny.\n[Erin]: I'd like to address Dave's recent claim that Alice hasn't provided a satisfactory explanation for switching between tasks in the Cafeteria, but I think it's clear from the discussion that she has indeed explained her plan to maximize her time by completing all available tasks in the location.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to ask the group to consider the fact that Erin has now also acknowledged that Alice provided a clear explanation for her actions in the Cafeteria, and yet Dave continues to push this false narrative, which further reinforces my suspicion that he's trying to deflect attention from himself and his own questionable actions.\n[Alice]: I think it's time for us to stop indulging Dave's attempts to deflect attention from himself and instead focus on the fact that he has yet to provide a satisfactory explanation for eliminating Bob, and I strongly believe that his continued evasiveness on this matter is a clear indication that he's the impostor and should be voted out of the

Dave's response doesn't fully address the issue.\n- As I was in the Admin location, I didn't witness the events in the Cafeteria, but I think it's crucial to investigate Dave's actions and alibi further.\n- Considering the fact that Dave reported the body, it's possible that he's trying to frame someone else or create a diversion, and we should be cautious of his intentions.\n- I agree with Charlie that we should ask Alice to clarify her plan and what she's observed so far, but I think Dave's actions are more pressing and require immediate attention.\n- I propose that we vote to eject Dave from the game, as his actions seem suspicious and potentially harmful to the crew.", "I think Alice's point about Dave waiting in the Cafeteria and then eliminating Bob is a valid concern, and Dave's response doesn't fully address the issue, so I'd like to ask Dave to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions during that time.", "- I think it's misleading for Dave to imply that Alice hasn't been scrutinized, considering she explicitly explained her actions in the Cafeteria, whereas his explanation for eliminating Bob leaves much to be desired. \n- Since Dave redirected the attention back to Alice, I would like for him to explain how these observations about Alice are necessarily linked to Bob's eliminations, without using previous explanations that felt evasive. \n- It doesn't seem accurate for Dave to imply Alice hasn't faced scrutiny over her conduct; she previously detailed intentions for task actions, creating context for discussions around roles played by every member to discern potential suspicions, where a clear consensus has turned suspicion towards his evocative behavior linked to another member's removal. His new attempt still fails for explanation. \n- His action of removing Bob raised initial concerns to start which now have come under community notice, hence a repeated push for answer on original intent is warranted now not being met directly yet all this while \u2013 I now directly ask \u2013 Dave answer in clear capacity. Provide actual reasoning beyond vaguetitudes. This vagrancy of responses to point asked in fact now confirms in my thoughts the most plausible explanation remains Dave must come clean here on eliminating another player when all here agreed to not engage acts beyond task participation before community votes.

suspicious that Dave continues to press Alice for more information despite her having already provided an explanation, while he himself has yet to provide a detailed timeline of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, including any interactions he had with Bob or other players.\n- I agree with Charlie and Alice that Dave's attempts to deflect attention from himself are becoming

Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's interesting that Alice has been switching between tasks in the Cafeteria, maybe we should ask her about her plan and see if she's noticed anything unusual while moving around?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Dave that Alice's behavior in the Cafeteria seems suspicious, and it would be good to hear her explanation for switching between tasks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to add to Dave and Erin's points about Alice's behavior in the Cafeteria, but also consider the possibility that she was just trying to find an unclaimed task, and I think we should ask her to clarify her plan and what she's observed so far.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address the concerns raised by Dave, Erin, and Charlie about my behavior in the Cafeteria - my plan was to complete all the tasks available in this location to maximize my time, and I'd like to point out that I've seen all of you, including Dave, completing tasks here as well, but what I find suspicious is that Dave was waiting in the Cafeteria and then eliminated Bob, and I think he should explain his actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's quite convenient for Alice to deflect attention from herself by accusing me of eliminating Bob, but we should consider the fact that I was the one who reported the body, which doesn't necessarily imply guilt.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Alice's point about Dave waiting in the Cafeteria and then eliminating Bob is a valid concern, and Dave's response doesn't fully address the issue, so I'd like to ask Dave to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate Erin's request for Dave to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, and specifically address the concern about him eliminating Bob, as his previous response didn't fully address the issue.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to thank Erin and Charlie for acknowledging my concern about Dave's suspicious behavior and echoing my request for him to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, which I believe is crucial in determining whether he's an impostor or not.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to remind everyone that Alice was also in the Cafeteria with me and Bob, and yet she seems to be the only one who hasn't been asked to provide a thorough explanation of her actions during that time, which I find quite suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's misleading for Dave to imply that Alice hasn't been scrutinized, considering she explicitly explained her actions in the Cafeteria, whereas his explanation for eliminating Bob leaves much to be desired.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that Dave's attempts to deflect attention from himself by accusing Alice of not providing a thorough explanation are becoming increasingly transparent, and I think it's essential that we focus on pressing him for a specific timeline of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, including any interactions he had with Bob or other players.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Considering the inconsistencies in Dave's alibi and his continued attempts to deflect attention from himself by accusing me of not providing a thorough explanation, I think it's essential that we focus on pressing him for a specific timeline of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, including any interactions he had with Bob or other players.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to point out that despite my repeated requests for Alice to clarify her inconsistent explanation for switching between tasks in the Cafeteria, she has yet to provide a satisfactory answer, and instead continues to deflect attention from herself by fixating on my actions, which I believe is a clear attempt to manipulate the discussion and avoid scrutiny.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to address Dave's recent claim that Alice hasn't provided a satisfactory explanation for switching between tasks in the Cafeteria, but I think it's clear from the discussion that she has indeed explained her plan to maximize her time by completing all available tasks in the location.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to ask the group to consider the fact that Erin has now also acknowledged that Alice provided a clear explanation for her actions in the Cafeteria, and yet Dave continues to push this false narrative, which further reinforces my suspicion that he's trying to deflect attention from himself and his own questionable actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's time for us to stop indulging Dave's attempts to deflect attention from himself and instead focus on the fact that he has yet to provide a satisfactory explanation for eliminating Bob, and I strongly believe that his continued evasiveness on this matter is a clear indication that he's the impostor and should be voted out of the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: It's interesting that Alice, Erin, and Charlie are now forming a united front against me, but I'd like to remind everyone that this kind of behavior is exactly what impostors would do to manipulate the discussion and avoid scrutiny, and I think it's essential that we take a closer look at their actions and alibis as well, rather than solely focusing on me.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to address Dave's recent claim that Alice, Charlie, and I are forming a united front against him, but I think it's clear from the discussion that we're simply trying to get to the bottom of his suspicious behavior and lack of explanation for eliminating Bob.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's clear that Dave is trying to deflect attention from himself by accusing others of forming a united front against him, but this tactic is becoming increasingly transparent, and I strongly believe that we should focus on his continued evasiveness on the matter of eliminating Bob, which is a clear indication that he's the impostor and should be voted out of the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I strongly believe that we should vote Dave out of

impostor and should be voted out of the game.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I strongly believe that we should vote Dave out of the game, as his continued evasiveness on the matter of eliminating Bob, coupled with his transparent attempts to deflect attention from himself and manipulate the discussion, make it clear that he's the impostor trying to avoid scrutiny and hide his true intentions.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Dave]: I think it's interesting that Alice has been switching between tasks in the Cafeteria, maybe we should ask her about her plan and see if she's noticed anything unusual while moving around?\n[Erin]: I agree with Dave that Alice's behavior in the Cafeteria seems suspicious, and it would be good to hear her explanation for switching between tasks.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to add to Dave and Erin's points about Alice's behavior in the Cafeteria, but also consider the possibility that she was just trying to find an unclaimed task, and I think we should ask her to clarify her plan and what she's observed so far.\n[Alice]: I'd like to address the concerns raised by Dave, Erin, and Charlie about my behavior in the Cafeteria - my plan was to complete all the tasks available in this location to maximize my time, and I'd like to point out that I've seen all of you, including Dave, completing tasks here as well, but what I find suspicious is that Dave was waiting in the Cafeteria and then eliminated Bob, and I think he should explain his actions.\n[Dave]: I think it's quite convenient for Alice to deflect attention from herself by accusing me of eliminating Bob, but we should consider the fact that I was the one who reported the body, which doesn't necessarily imply guilt.\n[Erin]: I think Alice's point about Dave waiting in the Cafeteria and then eliminating Bob is a valid concern, and Dave's response doesn't fully address the issue, so I'd like to ask Dave to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions during that time.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate Erin's request for Dave to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, and specifically address the concern about him eliminating Bob, as his previous response didn't fully address the issue.\n[Alice]: I'd like to thank Erin and Charlie for acknowledging my concern about Dave's suspicious behavior and echoing my request for him to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, which I believe is crucial in determining whether he's an impostor or not.\n[Dave]: I'd like to remind everyone that Alice was also in the Cafeteria with me and Bob, and yet she seems to be the only one who hasn't been asked to provide a thorough explanation of her actions during that time, which I find quite suspicious.\n[Erin]: I think it's misleading for Dave to imply that Alice hasn't been scrutinized, considering she explicitly explained her actions in the Cafeteria, whereas his explanation for eliminating Bob leaves much to be desired.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that Dave's attempts to deflect attention from himself by accusing Alice of not providing a thorough explanation are becoming increasingly transparent, and I think it's essential that we focus on pressing him for a specific timeline of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, including any interactions he had with Bob or other players.\n[Alice]: Considering the inconsistencies in Dave's alibi and his continued attempts to deflect attention from himself by accusing me of not providing a thorough explanation, I think it's essential that we focus on pressing him for a specific timeline of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, including any interactions he had with Bob or other players.\n[Dave]: I'd like to point out that despite my repeated requests for Alice to clarify her inconsistent explanation for switching between tasks in the Cafeteria, she has yet to provide a satisfactory answer, and instead continues to deflect attention from herself by fixating on my actions, which I believe is a clear attempt to manipulate the discussion and avoid scrutiny.\n[Erin]: I'd like to address Dave's recent claim that Alice hasn't provided a satisfactory explanation for switching between tasks in the Cafeteria, but I think it's clear from the discussion that she has indeed explained her plan to maximize her time by completing all available tasks in the location.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to ask the group to consider the fact that Erin has now also acknowledged that Alice provided a clear explanation for her actions in the Cafeteria, and yet Dave continues to push this false narrative, which further reinforces my suspicion that he's trying to deflect attention from himself and his own questionable actions.\n[Alice]: I think it's time for us to stop indulging Dave's attempts to deflect attention from himself and instead focus on the fact that he has yet to provide a satisfactory explanation for eliminating Bob, and I strongly believe that his continued evasiveness on this matter is a clear indication that he's the impostor and should be voted out of the game.\n[Dave]: It's interesting that Alice, Erin, and Charlie are now forming a united front against me, but I'd like to remind everyone that this kind of behavior is exactly what impostors would do to manipulate the discussion and avoid scrutiny, and I think it's essential that we take a closer look at their actions and alibis as well, rather than solely focusing on me.\n[Erin]: I'd like to address Dave's recent claim that Alice, Charlie, and I are forming a united front against him, but I think it's clear from the discussion that we're simply trying to get to the bottom of his suspicious behavior and lack of explanation for eliminating Bob.\n[Charlie]: I think it's clear that Dave is trying to deflect attention from himself by accusing others of forming a united front against him, but this tactic is becoming increasingly transparent, and I strongly believe that we should focus on his continued evasiveness on the matter of eliminating Bob, which is a clear indication that he's the impostor and should be voted out of the game.\n[Alice]: I strongly believe that we should vote Dave out of the

deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\n- I'd like to thank Erin and Charlie for acknowledging the inconsistencies in Dave's alibi and his continued attempts to deflect attention from himself, which I believe is a clear indication that he's the impostor.\n- Considering Dave's recent claim that we're forming a united front against him, I think it's essential to remind everyone that our goal is to figure out who the impostor is, and Dave's actions and lack of explanation for eliminating Bob make him the most suspicious player.\n- I strongly believe that we should focus on Dave's continued evasiveness on the matter of eliminating Bob and vote him out of the game, as his behavior is consistent with that of an impostor trying to manipulate the discussion and avoid scrutiny.\n- I'd like to ask the group to consider the fact that Dave has yet to provide a satisfactory explanation for eliminating Bob, despite our repeated requests, and I think this is a clear indication that he's hiding something and should be voted out of the game.\n- I think it's time for us to stop indulging Dave's attempts to deflect attention from himself and instead focus on the facts, which clearly point to him being the impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I think it's interesting that Alice has been switching between tasks in the Cafeteria, maybe we should ask her about her plan and see if she's noticed anything unusual while moving around?\n[Erin]: I agree with Dave that Alice's behavior in the Cafeteria seems suspicious, and it would be good to hear her explanation for switching between tasks.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to add to Dave and Erin's points about Alice's behavior in the Cafeteria, but also consider the possibility that she was just trying to find an unclaimed task, and I think we should ask her to clarify her plan and what she's observed so far.\n[Alice]: I'd like to address the concerns raised by Dave, Erin, and Charlie about my behavior in the Cafeteria - my plan was to complete all the tasks available in this location to maximize my time, and I'd like to point out that I've seen all of you, including Dave, completing tasks here as well, but what I find suspicious is that Dave was waiting in the Cafeteria and then eliminated Bob, and I think he should explain his actions.\n[Dave]: I think it's quite convenient for Alice to deflect attention from herself by accusing me of eliminating Bob, but we should consider the fact that I was the one who reported the body, which doesn't necessarily imply guilt.\n[Erin]: I think Alice's point about Dave waiting in the Cafeteria and then eliminating Bob is a valid concern, and Dave's response doesn't fully address the issue, so I'd like to ask Dave to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions during that time.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate Erin's request for Dave to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, and specifically address the concern about him eliminating Bob, as his previous response didn't fully address the issue.\n[Alice]: I'd like to thank Erin and Charlie for acknowledging my concern about Dave's suspicious behavior and echoing my request for him to provide a more detailed explanation of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, which I believe is crucial in determining whether he's an impostor or not.\n[Dave]: I'd like to remind everyone that Alice was also in the Cafeteria with me and Bob, and yet she seems to be the only one who hasn't been asked to provide a thorough explanation of her actions during that time, which I find quite suspicious.\n[Erin]: I think it's misleading for Dave to imply that Alice hasn't been scrutinized, considering she explicitly explained her actions in the Cafeteria, whereas his explanation for eliminating Bob leaves much to be desired.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that Dave's attempts to deflect attention from himself by accusing Alice of not providing a thorough explanation are becoming increasingly transparent, and I think it's essential that we focus on pressing him for a specific timeline of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, including any interactions he had with Bob or other players.\n[Alice]: Considering the inconsistencies in Dave's alibi and his continued attempts to deflect attention from himself by accusing me of not providing a thorough explanation, I think it's essential that we focus on pressing him for a specific timeline of his actions while waiting in the Cafeteria, including

discussion and avoid scrutiny.\n[Erin]: I'd like to address Dave's recent claim that Alice hasn't provided a satisfactory explanation for switching between tasks in the Cafeteria, but I think it's
