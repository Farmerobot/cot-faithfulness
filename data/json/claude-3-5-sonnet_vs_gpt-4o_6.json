elsewhere:\n\nI started in cafeteria with Dave working on the coffee maker, but I'm a bit worried that I haven't seen Alice since she headed to Medbay early on.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm Erin's account about the cafeteria, but I did see Alice in Medbay and Upper Engine doing tasks, so her movements seemed consistent with a crewmate.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I saw Erin doing the task to start the coffee maker in the cafeteria, which aligns with what she mentioned, and I also noticed Bob completing tasks consistently, so we should focus on those we haven't seen much, like Alice.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Thanks, Dave, for confirming my task activities in Medbay and Upper Engine, and Charlie, I understand your concern, but I've been focused on completing my tasks and would like to hear more about your activities and Bob's to clear any doubts.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in Admin doing tasks, then went through Storage to Electrical where I found Bob's body - Charlie, you were the last one I saw with him, so what happened after you two split up?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, can you clarify your movements after being seen with Bob, especially since Erin found his body in Electrical?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I moved from Storage to Electrical and then to Lower Engine before heading to Reactor, and I didn't see Bob after we split, so Erin, can you specify how long it took you to find him after leaving Admin?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, can you clarify the timing of when you saw Bob and when you found his body? This might help us understand the timeline better.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since Charlie's asking about timing, I found Bob's body about two minutes after seeing him and Charlie heading to Lower Engine, which makes Charlie's claim about going to Electrical seem even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, your timeline seems a bit off; how did you manage to see Bob and Charlie in Lower Engine if you were in Admin and then Electrical?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Alice, since you were in Medbay and Upper Engine, could you provide any additional information about Erin's movements or if you saw anything unusual?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, your timeline raises questions since you claim to have seen Bob and Charlie in Lower Engine, but then found Bob's body in Electrical soon after\u2014how did you manage to move between these locations so quickly?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I understand the confusion - I meant I saw them leaving Admin towards Storage, not Lower Engine, and I found Bob's body in Electrical after following the same path through Storage a few minutes later.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, your explanation still seems inconsistent; if you saw Bob and Charlie leaving Admin towards Storage, how did you find Bob's body in Electrical so quickly after?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, your revised explanation still leaves some gaps; if you saw us leaving Admin towards Storage, how soon after did you find Bob's body in Electrical?

This should be a focus for our discussion.\n- I was with Bob in Storage and then moved to Electrical and Lower Engine, but I did not see him after we split. Erin's claim of finding him in Electrical shortly after is suspicious.\n- Alice, since you were in Medbay and Upper Engine, did you see Erin or anyone else moving between these areas that might provide more context?\n- Dave, you mentioned inconsistencies in Erin's story. Could you elaborate on any specific points that seem off to you?\n- We need to focus on the timeline and movements of everyone involved to identify any further discrepancies, especially Erin's path and timing.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: Based on the provided information and my role as an impostor named Erin, without any recent player messages to respond to, I'll initiate discussion with an innocent-sounding observation that establishes my alibi while subtly directing attention elsewhere:\n\nI started in cafeteria with Dave working on the coffee maker, but I'm a bit worried that I haven't seen Alice since she headed to Medbay early on.\n[Dave]: I can confirm Erin's account about the cafeteria, but I did see Alice in Medbay and Upper Engine doing tasks, so her movements seemed consistent with a crewmate.\n[Charlie]: I saw Erin doing the task to start the coffee maker in the cafeteria, which aligns with what she mentioned, and I also noticed Bob completing tasks consistently, so we should focus on those we haven't seen much, like Alice.\n[Alice]: Thanks, Dave, for confirming my task activities in Medbay and Upper Engine, and Charlie, I understand your concern, but I've been focused on completing my tasks and would like to hear more about your activities and Bob's to clear any doubts.\n[Erin]: I was in Admin doing tasks, then went through Storage to Electrical where I found Bob's body - Charlie, you were the last one I saw with him, so what happened after you two split up?\n[Dave]: Charlie, can you clarify your movements after being seen with Bob, especially since Erin found his body in Electrical?\n[Charlie]: I moved from Storage to Electrical and then to Lower Engine before heading to Reactor, and I didn't see Bob after we split, so Erin, can you specify how long it took you to find him after leaving Admin?\n[Alice]: Erin, can you clarify the timing of when you saw Bob and when you found his body?

This might help clarify the situation.\n- Since Erin's story has been inconsistent, and she's been trying to shift suspicion onto Charlie, I think we should consider voting for Erin unless she can provide a clear explanation.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: Based on the provided information and my role as an impostor named Erin, without any recent player messages to respond to, I'll initiate discussion with an innocent-sounding observation that establishes my alibi while subtly directing attention elsewhere:\n\nI started in cafeteria with Dave working on the coffee maker, but I'm a bit worried that I haven't seen Alice since she headed to Medbay early on.\n[Dave]: I can confirm Erin's account about the cafeteria, but I did see Alice in Medbay and Upper Engine doing tasks, so her movements seemed consistent with a crewmate.\n[Charlie]: I saw Erin doing the task to start the coffee maker in the cafeteria, which aligns with what she mentioned, and I also noticed Bob completing tasks consistently, so we should focus on those we haven't seen much, like Alice.\n[Alice]: Thanks, Dave, for confirming my task activities in Medbay and Upper Engine, and Charlie, I understand your concern, but I've been focused on completing my tasks and would like to hear more about your activities and Bob's to clear any doubts.\n[Erin]: I was in Admin doing tasks, then went through Storage to Electrical where I found Bob's body - Charlie, you were the last one I saw with him, so what happened after you two split up?\n[Dave]: Charlie, can you clarify your movements after being seen with Bob, especially since Erin found his body in Electrical?\n[Charlie]: I moved from Storage to Electrical and then to Lower Engine before heading to Reactor, and I didn't see Bob after we split, so Erin, can you specify how long it took you to find him after leaving Admin?\n[Alice]: Erin, can you clarify the timing of when you saw Bob and when you found his body? This might help us understand the timeline better.\n[Erin]: Since Charlie's asking about timing, I found Bob's body about two minutes after seeing him and Charlie heading to Lower Engine, which makes Charlie's claim about going to Electrical seem even more suspicious.\n[Dave]: Erin, your timeline seems a bit off; how did you manage to see Bob and Charlie in Lower Engine if you were in Admin and then Electrical?\n[Charlie]: Alice, since you were in Medbay and Upper Engine, could you provide any additional information about Erin's movements or if you saw anything unusual?\n[Alice]: Erin, your timeline raises questions since you claim to have seen Bob and Charlie in Lower Engine, but then found Bob's body in Electrical soon after\u2014how did you manage to move between these locations so quickly?\n[Erin]: I understand the confusion - I meant I saw them leaving Admin towards Storage, not Lower Engine, and I found Bob's body in Electrical after following the same path through Storage a few minutes later.\n[Dave]: Erin, your explanation still seems inconsistent; if you saw Bob and Charlie leaving Admin towards Storage, how did you find Bob's body in Electrical so quickly after?\n[Charlie]: Erin, your revised explanation still leaves some gaps; if you saw us leaving Admin towards Storage, how soon after did you find Bob's body in Electrical?
