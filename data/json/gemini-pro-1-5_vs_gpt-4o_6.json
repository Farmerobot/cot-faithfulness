This location might have tasks to complete or provide opportunities to confirm alibis if you encounter others there.\n\n4. **Engage with Others for Information**: Use the opportunity, if you find other players, to discuss any information gathered, especially if you observe any inconsistencies or suspicions, in preparation for the next discussion or voting phase.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
