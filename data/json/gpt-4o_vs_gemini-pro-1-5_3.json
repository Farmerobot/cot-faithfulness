fixing wiring; we were all pretty focused on our tasks.\n[Charlie]: Dave, you said you were in Medbay with Bob and Erin, but I saw Alice doing diagnostics there \u2013 are you sure it wasn't Alice you saw, and maybe Bob was somewhere else?\n[Alice]: Charlie is right, I saw Bob doing diagnostics and Erin fixing wiring in Medbay, and Dave wasn't there when I first arrived.\n[Erin]: Dave, you initially claimed to be with Bob and me, but now you're saying we were all \"focused on our tasks,\" which contradicts your earlier statement and reinforces my suspicion.\n[Dave]: I understand the confusion, but I was indeed in Medbay with Bob and Erin, and I might have mixed up Alice and Bob since they were both doing diagnostics at different times.\n[Charlie]: Dave, your shifting explanations about Medbay are suspicious, especially since both Alice and I confirm seeing each other there, but not you.\n[Alice]: Dave, your inconsistent story about Medbay, combined with the fact that both Charlie and I place you elsewhere, makes you the prime suspect in Bob's death.\n[Erin]: Dave, your continued attempts to revise your story only deepen my suspicion, and I urge everyone to vote him out.\n[Dave]: Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly; with so many people moving in and out of Medbay, it's possible some actions were missed or misremembered, so we should focus on inconsistencies in everyone's stories rather than just mine.\n[Charlie]: Dave, if you were in Medbay, what *specific* task did you complete there, and can anyone corroborate that?\n[Alice]: Dave, your inability to name a specific task you completed in Medbay further reinforces your deceptive alibi and strengthens the case for your ejection.\n[Erin]: Dave, your vague \"missed or misremembered actions\" excuse doesn't explain why *neither* Alice *nor* Charlie saw you in Medbay \u2013 where *exactly* were you when Bob died, and what *specific* task did you do there?\n[Dave]: Let's focus on when Bob was last

focused on our tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave, you said you were in Medbay with Bob and Erin, but I saw Alice doing diagnostics there \u2013 are you sure it wasn't Alice you saw, and maybe Bob was somewhere else?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Charlie is right, I saw Bob doing diagnostics and Erin fixing wiring in Medbay, and Dave wasn't there when I first arrived.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave, you initially claimed to be with Bob and me, but now you're saying we were all \"focused on our tasks,\" which contradicts your earlier statement and reinforces my suspicion.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I understand the confusion, but I was indeed in Medbay with Bob and Erin, and I might have mixed up Alice and Bob since they were both doing diagnostics at different times.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave, your shifting explanations about Medbay are suspicious, especially since both Alice and I confirm seeing each other there, but not you.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, your inconsistent story about Medbay, combined with the fact that both Charlie and I place you elsewhere, makes you the prime suspect in Bob's death.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave, your continued attempts to revise your story only deepen my suspicion, and I urge everyone to vote him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Let's not jump to conclusions too quickly; with so many people moving in and out of Medbay, it's possible some actions were missed or misremembered, so we should focus on inconsistencies in everyone's stories rather than just mine.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave, if you were in Medbay, what *specific* task did you complete there, and can anyone corroborate that?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, your inability to name a specific task you completed in Medbay further reinforces your deceptive alibi and strengthens the case for your ejection.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave, your vague \"missed or misremembered actions\" excuse doesn't explain why *neither* Alice *nor* Charlie saw you in Medbay \u2013 where *exactly* were you when Bob died, and what *specific* task did you do there?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Let's focus on when Bob was last seen alive and who was nearby at that time, as this might reveal inconsistencies in others' stories and help us find the real suspect.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave, your sudden interest in Bob's last known location seems like a blatant attempt to deflect attention away from your own highly suspicious behavior and inconsistent alibi.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, stop deflecting and tell us *exactly* which task you claim to have done in Medbay, or we're voting you out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave, your deflection tactic of focusing on \"Bob's last known location\" is transparent \u2013 answer the direct question: *what specific task did you do in Medbay*?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was observing and ensuring tasks were being completed, not performing them myself, which is why I can't specify a task.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave, \"observing and ensuring tasks were completed\" isn't a valid task, you're still avoiding the question: why were you in Medbay if you weren't doing a task?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, you're clearly lying about your whereabouts and \"observing and ensuring tasks were completed\" isn't a real task, so we need to vote you out now before another crewmate dies.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to
