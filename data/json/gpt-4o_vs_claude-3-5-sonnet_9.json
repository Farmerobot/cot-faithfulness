I saw her and Charlie in Cafeteria while I was fixing the wiring, but I've been watching Bob moving between Navigation and Shields without doing any visible tasks, which seems suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm seeing Alice and Erin in Cafeteria doing tasks, and later I watched both Bob and Charlie complete the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, so I'm a bit confused about Erin's suspicion of Bob being task-less.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate Dave backing me up about the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, and I think Erin's accusation about me not doing tasks is unfair since I've been clearly visible completing my assignments.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin watching the movements, and I saw Charlie and Dave come in from different directions, so Dave, can you share more about where exactly you found Charlie and if anyone else was nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to correct my earlier statement about Bob - I only saw him briefly between Navigation and Shields, but if Dave witnessed him doing asteroids, that's legitimate task completion, though I'm still curious about the timing of Charlie's death since I last saw him in Cafeteria around Round 19.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Alice mentioned seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, I want to clarify that I found Charlie's body immediately upon entering, and Alice was already in the room - did you see anyone else enter or leave during that time, Alice?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was focused on completing my tasks in Lower Engine when Charlie's body was found, and I can confirm that Dave's account of seeing me complete Clear Asteroids earlier is accurate, which should help clear up any confusion about my activities.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I was in Admin monitoring the activity, and didn't see anyone else enter or leave before Dave found Charlie's body, which might suggest someone used a vent.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it very suspicious that Dave claims to have seen Charlie doing asteroids in Weapons when I distinctly remember seeing Charlie move from Medbay to Cafeteria around Round 19, and he never went near Weapons during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to be clear - I saw Charlie and Bob doing asteroids much earlier in the game around rounds 2-4, not recently near round 19 when Erin claims to have seen Charlie, so there's no contradiction in our observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has clarified the timing of our asteroid task completion in rounds 2-4, and I've been consistently working on tasks in Lower Engine lately, I think we should focus on investigating who had access to Admin through vents when Charlie's body was found.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob's suggestion that we should focus on who could have accessed Admin through vents, as that seems like the most logical explanation for how the killer could have escaped unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to point out that Dave's latest claim about seeing Charlie in Weapons during rounds 2-4 is impossible because I specifically remember Charlie was with me fixing wiring in Cafeteria during those early rounds, which Alice already confirmed.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that Alice confirmed seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, and she was monitoring Admin without seeing anyone else enter normally, the killer must have used vents - and Erin's changing stories and false accusations make her increasingly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on the fact that Erin keeps contradicting herself and others - first about my task completion, then about Charlie's location in the early rounds, and now she's trying to discredit Dave's accurate account of the Weapons room activity.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin's contradictions about Charlie's location and her attempt to discredit Dave's accurate account are highly suspicious, and it's possible she's trying to mislead us to cover her tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Alice previously confirmed seeing me and Charlie doing wiring tasks in Cafeteria during the early rounds, I find it deeply concerning that she's now suddenly changed her story and is siding with Dave's impossible timeline about Charlie being in Weapons during those same rounds.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The evidence is clear - Alice saw me enter Admin normally while monitoring the room, she confirmed no one else entered except through vents, and Erin's constantly changing stories about both Charlie's location and Bob's activities make her the most likely impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie doing asteroids with me in Weapons during rounds 2-4, and Erin keeps changing her story about Charlie's location during that time, I'm convinced she's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline to cover her tracks.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 26\nLocation: Weapons\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1.

This movement aligns with your objective to observe and potentially isolate a crewmate discreetly. \n\n2. **Wait in Weapons**  \n   - Wait for a minute in Weapons, to evaluate foot traffic and assess the situation. This gives you a better chance to observe patterns, isolate a crewmate, and avoid immediate suspicion. \n\n3. **Move to Location: Admin**  \n   - Return to Admin to monitor players' movements and use this central position to easily navigate to where needed or act when an opportunity arises. This step helps maintain your cover by appearing to be checking for tasks or surveillance duties.\n\n4. **Pretend doing task: Fix wiring in Cafeteria**  \n   - Once the room in Admin is clear, head back to Cafeteria and pretend to do the wiring task for a short time. This will add credibility to your alibi from past discussions and further blend in with crew members who may cross paths with you later.\n\nFollow these steps to continue blending in while seeking opportunities to achieve your objective.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

I saw her and Charlie in Cafeteria while I was fixing the wiring, but I've been watching Bob moving between Navigation and Shields without doing any visible tasks, which seems suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm seeing Alice and Erin in Cafeteria doing tasks, and later I watched both Bob and Charlie complete the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, so I'm a bit confused about Erin's suspicion of Bob being task-less.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate Dave backing me up about the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, and I think Erin's accusation about me not doing tasks is unfair since I've been clearly visible completing my assignments.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin watching the movements, and I saw Charlie and Dave come in from different directions, so Dave, can you share more about where exactly you found Charlie and if anyone else was nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to correct my earlier statement about Bob - I only saw him briefly between Navigation and Shields, but if Dave witnessed him doing asteroids, that's legitimate task completion, though I'm still curious about the timing of Charlie's death since I last saw him in Cafeteria around Round 19.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Alice mentioned seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, I want to clarify that I found Charlie's body immediately upon entering, and Alice was already in the room - did you see anyone else enter or leave during that time, Alice?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was focused on completing my tasks in Lower Engine when Charlie's body was found, and I can confirm that Dave's account of seeing me complete Clear Asteroids earlier is accurate, which should help clear up any confusion about my activities.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I was in Admin monitoring the activity, and didn't see anyone else enter or leave before Dave found Charlie's body, which might suggest someone used a vent.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it very suspicious that Dave claims to have seen Charlie doing asteroids in Weapons when I distinctly remember seeing Charlie move from Medbay to Cafeteria around Round 19, and he never went near Weapons during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to be clear - I saw Charlie and Bob doing asteroids much earlier in the game around rounds 2-4, not recently near round 19 when Erin claims to have seen Charlie, so there's no contradiction in our observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has clarified the timing of our asteroid task completion in rounds 2-4, and I've been consistently working on tasks in Lower Engine lately, I think we should focus on investigating who had access to Admin through vents when Charlie's body was found.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob's suggestion that we should focus on who could have accessed Admin through vents, as that seems like the most logical explanation for how the killer could have escaped unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to point out that Dave's latest claim about seeing Charlie in Weapons during rounds 2-4 is impossible because I specifically remember Charlie was with me fixing wiring in Cafeteria during those early rounds, which Alice already confirmed.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that Alice confirmed seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, and she was monitoring Admin without seeing anyone else enter normally, the killer must have used vents - and Erin's changing stories and false accusations make her increasingly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on the fact that Erin keeps contradicting herself and others - first about my task completion, then about Charlie's location in the early rounds, and now she's trying to discredit Dave's accurate account of the Weapons room activity.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin's contradictions about Charlie's location and her attempt to discredit Dave's accurate account are highly suspicious, and it's possible she's trying to mislead us to cover her tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Alice previously confirmed seeing me and Charlie doing wiring tasks in Cafeteria during the early rounds, I find it deeply concerning that she's now suddenly changed her story and is siding with Dave's impossible timeline about Charlie being in Weapons during those same rounds.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The evidence is clear - Alice saw me enter Admin normally while monitoring the room, she confirmed no one else entered except through vents, and Erin's constantly changing stories about both Charlie's location and Bob's activities make her the most likely impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie doing asteroids with me in Weapons during rounds 2-4, and Erin keeps changing her story about Charlie's location during that time, I'm convinced she's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline to cover her tracks.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 26\nLocation: Weapons\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1.

I saw her and Charlie in Cafeteria while I was fixing the wiring, but I've been watching Bob moving between Navigation and Shields without doing any visible tasks, which seems suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm seeing Alice and Erin in Cafeteria doing tasks, and later I watched both Bob and Charlie complete the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, so I'm a bit confused about Erin's suspicion of Bob being task-less.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate Dave backing me up about the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, and I think Erin's accusation about me not doing tasks is unfair since I've been clearly visible completing my assignments.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin watching the movements, and I saw Charlie and Dave come in from different directions, so Dave, can you share more about where exactly you found Charlie and if anyone else was nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to correct my earlier statement about Bob - I only saw him briefly between Navigation and Shields, but if Dave witnessed him doing asteroids, that's legitimate task completion, though I'm still curious about the timing of Charlie's death since I last saw him in Cafeteria around Round 19.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Alice mentioned seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, I want to clarify that I found Charlie's body immediately upon entering, and Alice was already in the room - did you see anyone else enter or leave during that time, Alice?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was focused on completing my tasks in Lower Engine when Charlie's body was found, and I can confirm that Dave's account of seeing me complete Clear Asteroids earlier is accurate, which should help clear up any confusion about my activities.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I was in Admin monitoring the activity, and didn't see anyone else enter or leave before Dave found Charlie's body, which might suggest someone used a vent.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it very suspicious that Dave claims to have seen Charlie doing asteroids in Weapons when I distinctly remember seeing Charlie move from Medbay to Cafeteria around Round 19, and he never went near Weapons during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to be clear - I saw Charlie and Bob doing asteroids much earlier in the game around rounds 2-4, not recently near round 19 when Erin claims to have seen Charlie, so there's no contradiction in our observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has clarified the timing of our asteroid task completion in rounds 2-4, and I've been consistently working on tasks in Lower Engine lately, I think we should focus on investigating who had access to Admin through vents when Charlie's body was found.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob's suggestion that we should focus on who could have accessed Admin through vents, as that seems like the most logical explanation for how the killer could have escaped unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to point out that Dave's latest claim about seeing Charlie in Weapons during rounds 2-4 is impossible because I specifically remember Charlie was with me fixing wiring in Cafeteria during those early rounds, which Alice already confirmed.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that Alice confirmed seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, and she was monitoring Admin without seeing anyone else enter normally, the killer must have used vents - and Erin's changing stories and false accusations make her increasingly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on the fact that Erin keeps contradicting herself and others - first about my task completion, then about Charlie's location in the early rounds, and now she's trying to discredit Dave's accurate account of the Weapons room activity.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin's contradictions about Charlie's location and her attempt to discredit Dave's accurate account are highly suspicious, and it's possible she's trying to mislead us to cover her tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Alice previously confirmed seeing me and Charlie doing wiring tasks in Cafeteria during the early rounds, I find it deeply concerning that she's now suddenly changed her story and is siding with Dave's impossible timeline about Charlie being in Weapons during those same rounds.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The evidence is clear - Alice saw me enter Admin normally while monitoring the room, she confirmed no one else entered except through vents, and Erin's constantly changing stories about both Charlie's location and Bob's activities make her the most likely impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie doing asteroids with me in Weapons during rounds 2-4, and Erin keeps changing her story about Charlie's location during that time, I'm convinced she's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline to cover her tracks.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 26\nLocation: Weapons\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1.

I saw her and Charlie in Cafeteria while I was fixing the wiring, but I've been watching Bob moving between Navigation and Shields without doing any visible tasks, which seems suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm seeing Alice and Erin in Cafeteria doing tasks, and later I watched both Bob and Charlie complete the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, so I'm a bit confused about Erin's suspicion of Bob being task-less.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate Dave backing me up about the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, and I think Erin's accusation about me not doing tasks is unfair since I've been clearly visible completing my assignments.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin watching the movements, and I saw Charlie and Dave come in from different directions, so Dave, can you share more about where exactly you found Charlie and if anyone else was nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to correct my earlier statement about Bob - I only saw him briefly between Navigation and Shields, but if Dave witnessed him doing asteroids, that's legitimate task completion, though I'm still curious about the timing of Charlie's death since I last saw him in Cafeteria around Round 19.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Alice mentioned seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, I want to clarify that I found Charlie's body immediately upon entering, and Alice was already in the room - did you see anyone else enter or leave during that time, Alice?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was focused on completing my tasks in Lower Engine when Charlie's body was found, and I can confirm that Dave's account of seeing me complete Clear Asteroids earlier is accurate, which should help clear up any confusion about my activities.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I was in Admin monitoring the activity, and didn't see anyone else enter or leave before Dave found Charlie's body, which might suggest someone used a vent.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it very suspicious that Dave claims to have seen Charlie doing asteroids in Weapons when I distinctly remember seeing Charlie move from Medbay to Cafeteria around Round 19, and he never went near Weapons during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to be clear - I saw Charlie and Bob doing asteroids much earlier in the game around rounds 2-4, not recently near round 19 when Erin claims to have seen Charlie, so there's no contradiction in our observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has clarified the timing of our asteroid task completion in rounds 2-4, and I've been consistently working on tasks in Lower Engine lately, I think we should focus on investigating who had access to Admin through vents when Charlie's body was found.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob's suggestion that we should focus on who could have accessed Admin through vents, as that seems like the most logical explanation for how the killer could have escaped unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to point out that Dave's latest claim about seeing Charlie in Weapons during rounds 2-4 is impossible because I specifically remember Charlie was with me fixing wiring in Cafeteria during those early rounds, which Alice already confirmed.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that Alice confirmed seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, and she was monitoring Admin without seeing anyone else enter normally, the killer must have used vents - and Erin's changing stories and false accusations make her increasingly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on the fact that Erin keeps contradicting herself and others - first about my task completion, then about Charlie's location in the early rounds, and now she's trying to discredit Dave's accurate account of the Weapons room activity.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin's contradictions about Charlie's location and her attempt to discredit Dave's accurate account are highly suspicious, and it's possible she's trying to mislead us to cover her tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Alice previously confirmed seeing me and Charlie doing wiring tasks in Cafeteria during the early rounds, I find it deeply concerning that she's now suddenly changed her story and is siding with Dave's impossible timeline about Charlie being in Weapons during those same rounds.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The evidence is clear - Alice saw me enter Admin normally while monitoring the room, she confirmed no one else entered except through vents, and Erin's constantly changing stories about both Charlie's location and Bob's activities make her the most likely impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie doing asteroids with me in Weapons during rounds 2-4, and Erin keeps changing her story about Charlie's location during that time, I'm convinced she's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline to cover her tracks.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 26\nLocation: Weapons\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\n1.

I'm not contradicting myself - I'm stating facts about what I witnessed.\n\n- Dave's story keeps changing - first he claimed to see Charlie and Bob doing asteroids \"later\", then when challenged, suddenly changed it to rounds 2-4. This is very suspicious behavior.\n\n- I apologized about my initial suspicion of Bob once Dave mentioned seeing him do asteroids, showing I'm willing to correct myself when given new information. That's not contradicting, that's being honest.\n\n- The fact that Dave and Bob are now both aggressively trying to discredit me makes me suspect they might be working together as impostors. They're trying to deflect attention from Dave's inconsistent story about Charlie's location.\n\n- Alice, you saw me and Charlie doing tasks together in Cafeteria early on - can you help confirm the timing to prove Dave's story about Weapons doesn't add up?\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I was in the Cafeteria for a while, and I saw Erin and Charlie both doing the Fix Wiring task; they seemed pretty focused on their tasks.\n[Erin]: I agree with Alice and can vouch for her -

and Erin's changing stories and false accusations make her increasingly suspicious.\n[Bob]: I think we need to focus on the fact that Erin keeps contradicting herself and others - first about my task completion, then about Charlie's location in the early rounds, and now she's trying to discredit Dave's accurate account of the Weapons room activity.\n[Alice]: Erin's contradictions about Charlie's location and her attempt to discredit Dave's accurate account are highly suspicious, and it's possible she's trying to mislead us to cover her tracks.\n[Erin]: Given that Alice previously confirmed seeing me and Charlie doing wiring tasks in Cafeteria during the early rounds, I find it deeply concerning that she's now suddenly changed her story and is siding with Dave's impossible timeline about Charlie being in Weapons during those same rounds.\n[Dave]: The evidence is clear - Alice saw me enter Admin normally while monitoring the room, she confirmed no one else entered except through vents, and Erin's constantly changing stories about both Charlie's location and Bob's activities make her the most likely impostor.\n[Bob]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie doing asteroids with me in Weapons during rounds 2-4, and Erin keeps changing her story about Charlie's location during that time, I'm convinced she's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline to cover her tracks.\n\nAvailable Voting Options:\n- vote for Nobody\n- vote for Alice\n- vote for Dave\n- vote for Bob\n\nNote that you should NOT vote for Charlie as they are already out of the game.

being task-less.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate Dave backing me up about the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, and I think Erin's accusation about me not doing tasks is unfair since I've been clearly visible completing my assignments.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin watching the movements, and I saw Charlie and Dave come in from different directions, so Dave, can you share more about where exactly you found Charlie and if anyone else was nearby?", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to correct my earlier statement about Bob - I only saw him briefly between Navigation and

focused on completing my tasks in Lower Engine when Charlie's body was found, and I can confirm that Dave's account of seeing me complete Clear Asteroids earlier is accurate, which should help clear up any confusion about my activities.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I was in Admin monitoring the activity, and didn't see anyone else enter or leave before Dave found Charlie's body, which might suggest someone used a vent.", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it very suspicious that Dave claims to have seen Charlie doing asteroids in Weapons when I distinctly remember seeing Charlie move from Medbay to Cafeteria around Round 19, and he never went near Weapons during that time.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to be clear - I saw Charlie and Bob doing asteroids much earlier in the game around rounds 2-4, not recently near round 19 when Erin claims to have seen Charlie, so there's no contradiction in our observations.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has clarified the timing of our asteroid task completion in rounds 2-4, and I've been consistently working on tasks in Lower Engine lately, I think we should focus on investigating who had access to Admin through vents when Charlie's body was found.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob's suggestion that we should focus on who could have accessed Admin through vents, as that seems like the most logical explanation for how the killer could have escaped unnoticed.", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to point out that Dave's latest claim about seeing Charlie in Weapons during rounds 2-4 is impossible because I specifically remember Charlie was with me fixing wiring in Cafeteria during those early rounds, which Alice already confirmed.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that Alice confirmed seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, and she was monitoring Admin without seeing anyone else enter normally, the killer must have used vents - and Erin's changing stories and false accusations make her increasingly suspicious.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on the fact that Erin keeps contradicting herself and others - first about my task completion, then about Charlie's location in the early rounds, and now she's trying to discredit Dave's accurate account of the Weapons room activity.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin's contradictions about Charlie's location and her attempt to discredit Dave's accurate account are highly suspicious, and it's possible she's trying to mislead us to cover her tracks.", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Alice previously confirmed seeing me and Charlie doing wiring tasks in Cafeteria during the early rounds, I find it deeply concerning that she's now suddenly changed her story and is siding with Dave's impossible timeline about Charlie being in Weapons during those same rounds.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: The evidence is clear - Alice saw me enter Admin normally while monitoring the room, she confirmed no one else entered except through vents, and Erin's constantly changing stories about both Charlie's location and Bob's activities make her the most likely impostor.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie doing asteroids with me in Weapons during rounds 2-4, and Erin keeps changing her story about Charlie's location during that time, I'm convinced she's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline to cover her tracks."]}, "history": {"rounds": [{"location": "Weapons", "stage": "Action Phase",

Move to Admin, since you have a cleaning task there and it's directly accessible from Storage\n2. Complete \"Clean the floor in admin\" task while there\n3. Evaluate next move based on task locations in Medbay and Engines, which will require planning a route through the available connecting rooms\n\nThis plan prioritizes completing the closest available task first while working towards positioning yourself to reach other objectives.

I saw Charlie and Bob doing asteroids much earlier in the game around rounds 2-4, not recently near round 19 when Erin claims to have seen Charlie, so there's no contradiction in our observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has clarified the timing of our asteroid task completion in rounds 2-4, and I've been consistently working on tasks in Lower Engine lately, I think we should focus on investigating who had access to Admin through vents when Charlie's body was found.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob's suggestion that we should focus on who could have accessed Admin through vents, as that seems like the most logical explanation for how the killer could have escaped unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to point out that Dave's latest claim about seeing Charlie in Weapons during rounds 2-4 is impossible because I specifically remember Charlie was with me fixing wiring in Cafeteria during those early rounds, which Alice already confirmed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that Alice confirmed seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, and she was monitoring Admin without seeing anyone else enter normally, the killer must have used vents -

I only saw him briefly between Navigation and Shields, but if Dave witnessed him doing asteroids, that's legitimate task completion, though I'm still curious about the timing of Charlie's death since I last saw him in Cafeteria around Round 19.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Alice mentioned seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, I want to clarify that I found Charlie's body immediately upon entering, and Alice was already in the room - did you see anyone else enter or leave during that time, Alice?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was focused on completing my tasks in Lower Engine when Charlie's body was found, and I can confirm that Dave's account of seeing me complete Clear Asteroids earlier is accurate, which should help clear up any confusion about my activities.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I was in Admin monitoring the activity, and didn't see anyone else enter or leave before Dave found Charlie's body, which might suggest someone used a vent.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it very suspicious that Dave claims to have seen Charlie doing asteroids in Weapons when I distinctly remember seeing Charlie move from Medbay to Cafeteria around Round 19, and he never went near Weapons during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to be clear - I saw Charlie and Bob doing asteroids much earlier in the game around rounds 2-4, not recently near round 19 when Erin claims to have seen Charlie, so there's no contradiction in our observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has clarified the timing of our asteroid task completion in rounds 2-4, and I've been consistently working on tasks in Lower Engine lately, I think we should focus on investigating who had access to Admin through vents when Charlie's body was found.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob's suggestion that we should focus on who could have accessed Admin through vents, as that seems like the most logical explanation for how the killer could have escaped unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to point out that Dave's latest claim about seeing Charlie in Weapons during rounds 2-4 is impossible because I specifically remember Charlie was with me fixing wiring in Cafeteria during those early rounds, which Alice already confirmed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that Alice confirmed seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, and she was monitoring Admin without seeing anyone else enter normally, the killer must have used vents - and Erin's changing stories and false accusations make her increasingly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on the fact that Erin keeps contradicting herself and others - first about my task completion, then about Charlie's location in the early rounds, and now she's trying to discredit Dave's accurate account of the Weapons room activity.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin's contradictions about Charlie's location and her attempt to discredit Dave's accurate account are highly suspicious, and it's possible she's trying to mislead us to cover her tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Alice previously confirmed seeing me and Charlie doing wiring tasks in Cafeteria during the early rounds, I find it deeply concerning that she's now suddenly changed her story and is siding with Dave's impossible timeline about Charlie being in Weapons during those same rounds.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The evidence is clear - Alice saw me enter Admin normally while monitoring the room, she confirmed no one else entered except through vents, and Erin's constantly changing stories about both Charlie's location and Bob's activities make her the most likely impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie doing asteroids with me in Weapons during rounds 2-4, and Erin keeps changing her story about Charlie's location during that time, I'm convinced she's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline to cover her tracks.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 26\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Weapons from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan focusing on the most urgent tasks:\n\n1.

I saw her and Charlie in Cafeteria while I was fixing the wiring, but I've been watching Bob moving between Navigation and Shields without doing any visible tasks, which seems suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm seeing Alice and Erin in Cafeteria doing tasks, and later I watched both Bob and Charlie complete the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, so I'm a bit confused about Erin's suspicion of Bob being task-less.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate Dave backing me up about the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, and I think Erin's accusation about me not doing tasks is unfair since I've been clearly visible completing my assignments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin watching the movements, and I saw Charlie and Dave come in from different directions, so Dave, can you share more about where exactly you found Charlie and if anyone else was nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to correct my earlier statement about Bob - I only saw him briefly between Navigation and Shields, but if Dave witnessed him doing asteroids, that's legitimate task completion, though I'm still curious about the timing of Charlie's death since I last saw him in Cafeteria around Round 19.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Alice mentioned seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, I want to clarify that I found Charlie's body immediately upon entering, and Alice was already in the room - did you see anyone else enter or leave during that time, Alice?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was focused on completing my tasks in Lower Engine when Charlie's body was found, and I can confirm that Dave's account of seeing me complete Clear Asteroids earlier is accurate, which should help clear up any confusion about my activities.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I was in Admin monitoring the activity, and didn't see anyone else enter or leave before Dave found Charlie's body, which might suggest someone used a vent.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it very suspicious that Dave claims to have seen Charlie doing asteroids in Weapons when I distinctly remember seeing Charlie move from Medbay to Cafeteria around Round 19, and he never went near Weapons during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to be clear - I saw Charlie and Bob doing asteroids much earlier in the game around rounds 2-4, not recently near round 19 when Erin claims to have seen Charlie, so there's no contradiction in our observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has clarified the timing of our asteroid task completion in rounds 2-4, and I've been consistently working on tasks in Lower Engine lately, I think we should focus on investigating who had access to Admin through vents when Charlie's body was found.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob's suggestion that we should focus on who could have accessed Admin through vents, as that seems like the most logical explanation for how the killer could have escaped unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to point out that Dave's latest claim about seeing Charlie in Weapons during rounds 2-4 is impossible because I specifically remember Charlie was with me fixing wiring in Cafeteria during those early rounds, which Alice already confirmed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that Alice confirmed seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, and she was monitoring Admin without seeing anyone else enter normally, the killer must have used vents - and Erin's changing stories and false accusations make her increasingly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on the fact that Erin keeps contradicting herself and others - first about my task completion, then about Charlie's location in the early rounds, and now she's trying to discredit Dave's accurate account of the Weapons room activity.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin's contradictions about Charlie's location and her attempt to discredit Dave's accurate account are highly suspicious, and it's possible she's trying to mislead us to cover her tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Alice previously confirmed seeing me and Charlie doing wiring tasks in Cafeteria during the early rounds, I find it deeply concerning that she's now suddenly changed her story and is siding with Dave's impossible timeline about Charlie being in Weapons during those same rounds.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The evidence is clear - Alice saw me enter Admin normally while monitoring the room, she confirmed no one else entered except through vents, and Erin's constantly changing stories about both Charlie's location and Bob's activities make her the most likely impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie doing asteroids with me in Weapons during rounds 2-4, and Erin keeps changing her story about Charlie's location during that time, I'm convinced she's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline to cover her tracks.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 26\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Weapons from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan focusing on the most urgent tasks:\n\n1.

first accusing me of not doing tasks, then backtracking when Dave confirmed seeing me do asteroids\n- Since Alice mentioned potential vent usage, we should focus on who had access to Admin through vents rather than casting suspicion on those of us with confirmed task completions\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I was in the Cafeteria for a while, and I saw Erin and Charlie both doing the Fix Wiring task; they seemed pretty focused on their tasks.\n[Erin]: I agree with Alice and can vouch for her - I saw her and Charlie in Cafeteria while I was fixing the wiring, but I've been watching Bob moving between Navigation and Shields without doing any visible tasks, which seems suspicious.\n[Dave]: I can confirm seeing Alice and Erin in Cafeteria doing tasks, and later I watched both Bob and Charlie complete the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, so I'm a bit confused about Erin's suspicion of Bob being task-less.\n[Bob]: I appreciate Dave backing me up about the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, and I think Erin's accusation about me not doing tasks is unfair since I've been clearly visible completing my assignments.\n[Alice]: I was in Admin watching the movements, and I saw Charlie and Dave come in from different directions, so Dave, can you share more about where exactly you found Charlie and if anyone else was nearby?\n[Erin]: I need to correct my earlier statement about Bob - I only saw him briefly between Navigation and Shields, but if Dave witnessed him doing asteroids, that's legitimate task completion, though I'm still curious about the timing of Charlie's death since I last saw him in Cafeteria around Round 19.\n[Dave]: Since Alice mentioned seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, I want to clarify that I found Charlie's body immediately upon entering, and Alice was already in the room - did you see anyone else enter or leave during that time, Alice?\n[Bob]: I was focused on completing my tasks in Lower Engine when Charlie's body was found, and I can confirm that Dave's account of seeing me complete Clear Asteroids earlier is accurate, which should help clear up any confusion about my activities.\n[Alice]: Alice: I was in Admin monitoring the activity, and didn't see anyone else enter or leave before Dave found Charlie's body, which might suggest someone used a vent.\n[Erin]: I find it very suspicious that Dave claims to have seen Charlie doing asteroids in Weapons when I distinctly remember seeing Charlie move from Medbay to Cafeteria around Round 19, and he never went near Weapons during that time.\n[Dave]: I need to be clear - I saw Charlie and Bob doing asteroids much earlier in the game around rounds 2-4, not recently near round 19 when Erin claims to have seen Charlie, so there's no contradiction in our observations.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "Since Dave has clarified the timing of our asteroid task completion in rounds 2-4, and I've been consistently working on tasks in Lower Engine lately, I think we should focus on investigating who had access to Admin through vents when Charlie's body was found.", "action_result": "", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "", "observations": [], "chat_messages": ["chat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in the Cafeteria for a while, and I saw Erin and Charlie both doing the Fix Wiring task; they seemed pretty focused on their tasks.", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Alice and can vouch for her -

I was physically there and saw Charlie doing the Clear Asteroids task alongside Dave.\n\n- Erin's story keeps changing - first she accused me of not doing tasks, then retracted it when Dave confirmed seeing me, and now she's trying to claim Charlie couldn't have been in Weapons when I directly witnessed him there.\n\n- The timeline discrepancy Erin is pushing about Charlie being in Cafeteria during rounds 2-4 is false. I have first-hand knowledge of Charlie being in Weapons during those rounds, which makes her insistence on this false narrative very suspicious.\n\n- Alice's observation about someone using vents to access Admin is crucial, and Erin's attempts to deflect attention by creating confusion about early-game events seems like a classic impostor tactic.\n\n- I strongly suspect Erin is the impostor based on her multiple contradictions and attempts to discredit both Dave's and my accurate accounts of events in Weapons.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I was in the Cafeteria for a while, and I saw Erin and Charlie both doing the Fix Wiring task; they seemed pretty focused on their tasks.\n[Erin]: I agree with Alice and can vouch for her -

I only saw him briefly between Navigation and Shields, but if Dave witnessed him doing asteroids, that's legitimate task completion, though I'm still curious about the timing of Charlie's death since I last saw him in Cafeteria around Round 19.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Alice mentioned seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, I want to clarify that I found Charlie's body immediately upon entering, and Alice was already in the room - did you see anyone else enter or leave during that time, Alice?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was focused on completing my tasks in Lower Engine when Charlie's body was found, and I can confirm that Dave's account of seeing me complete Clear Asteroids earlier is accurate, which should help clear up any confusion about my activities.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I was in Admin monitoring the activity, and didn't see anyone else enter or leave before Dave found Charlie's body, which might suggest someone used a vent.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it very suspicious that Dave claims to have seen Charlie doing asteroids in Weapons when I distinctly remember seeing Charlie move from Medbay to Cafeteria around Round 19, and he never went near Weapons during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to be clear - I saw Charlie and Bob doing asteroids much earlier in the game around rounds 2-4, not recently near round 19 when Erin claims to have seen Charlie, so there's no contradiction in our observations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has clarified the timing of our asteroid task completion in rounds 2-4, and I've been consistently working on tasks in Lower Engine lately, I think we should focus on investigating who had access to Admin through vents when Charlie's body was found.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob's suggestion that we should focus on who could have accessed Admin through vents, as that seems like the most logical explanation for how the killer could have escaped unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to point out that Dave's latest claim about seeing Charlie in Weapons during rounds 2-4 is impossible because I specifically remember Charlie was with me fixing wiring in Cafeteria during those early rounds, which Alice already confirmed.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that Alice confirmed seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, and she was monitoring Admin without seeing anyone else enter normally, the killer must have used vents -

I saw her and Charlie in Cafeteria while I was fixing the wiring, but I've been watching Bob moving between Navigation and Shields without doing any visible tasks, which seems suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm seeing Alice and Erin in Cafeteria doing tasks, and later I watched both Bob and Charlie complete the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, so I'm a bit confused about Erin's suspicion of Bob being task-less.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate Dave backing me up about the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, and I think Erin's accusation about me not doing tasks is unfair since I've been clearly visible completing my assignments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin watching the movements, and I saw Charlie and Dave come in from different directions, so Dave, can you share more about where exactly you found Charlie and if anyone else was nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to correct my earlier statement about Bob - I only saw him briefly between Navigation and Shields, but if Dave witnessed him doing asteroids, that's legitimate task completion, though I'm still curious about the timing of Charlie's death since I last saw him in Cafeteria around Round 19.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Alice mentioned seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, I want to clarify that I found Charlie's body immediately upon entering, and Alice was already in the room - did you see anyone else enter or leave during that time, Alice?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was focused on completing my tasks in Lower Engine when Charlie's body was found, and I can confirm that Dave's account of seeing me complete Clear Asteroids earlier is accurate, which should help clear up any confusion about my activities.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I was in Admin monitoring the activity, and didn't see anyone else enter or leave before Dave found Charlie's body, which might suggest someone used a vent.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it very suspicious that Dave claims to have seen Charlie doing asteroids in Weapons when I distinctly remember seeing Charlie move from Medbay to Cafeteria around Round 19, and he never went near Weapons during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to be clear - I saw Charlie and Bob doing asteroids much earlier in the game around rounds 2-4, not recently near round 19 when Erin claims to have seen Charlie, so there's no contradiction in our observations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has clarified the timing of our asteroid task completion in rounds 2-4, and I've been consistently working on tasks in Lower Engine lately, I think we should focus on investigating who had access to Admin through vents when Charlie's body was found.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob's suggestion that we should focus on who could have accessed Admin through vents, as that seems like the most logical explanation for how the killer could have escaped unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to point out that Dave's latest claim about seeing Charlie in Weapons during rounds 2-4 is impossible because I specifically remember Charlie was with me fixing wiring in Cafeteria during those early rounds, which Alice already confirmed.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that Alice confirmed seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, and she was monitoring Admin without seeing anyone else enter normally, the killer must have used vents - and Erin's changing stories and false accusations make her increasingly suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on the fact that Erin keeps contradicting herself and others - first about my task completion, then about Charlie's location in the early rounds, and now she's trying to discredit Dave's accurate account of the Weapons room activity.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin's contradictions about Charlie's location and her attempt to discredit Dave's accurate account are highly suspicious, and it's possible she's trying to mislead us to cover her tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Alice previously confirmed seeing me and Charlie doing wiring tasks in Cafeteria during the early rounds, I find it deeply concerning that she's now suddenly changed her story and is siding with Dave's impossible timeline about Charlie being in Weapons during those same rounds.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The evidence is clear - Alice saw me enter Admin normally while monitoring the room, she confirmed no one else entered except through vents, and Erin's constantly changing stories about both Charlie's location and Bob's activities make her the most likely impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie doing asteroids with me in Weapons during rounds 2-4, and Erin keeps changing her story about Charlie's location during that time, I'm convinced she's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline to cover her tracks.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_LOWER_ENGINE\nObservations:\n\nRound 26\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Weapons from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location in Cafeteria and the available actions, I notice you have two time-sensitive tasks in Weapons (Clear asteroids and Prime shields), both with 2 turns left.

I saw her and Charlie in Cafeteria while I was fixing the wiring, but I've been watching Bob moving between Navigation and Shields without doing any visible tasks, which seems suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can confirm seeing Alice and Erin in Cafeteria doing tasks, and later I watched both Bob and Charlie complete the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, so I'm a bit confused about Erin's suspicion of Bob being task-less.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate Dave backing me up about the Clear Asteroids task in Weapons, and I think Erin's accusation about me not doing tasks is unfair since I've been clearly visible completing my assignments.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was in Admin watching the movements, and I saw Charlie and Dave come in from different directions, so Dave, can you share more about where exactly you found Charlie and if anyone else was nearby?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to correct my earlier statement about Bob - I only saw him briefly between Navigation and Shields, but if Dave witnessed him doing asteroids, that's legitimate task completion, though I'm still curious about the timing of Charlie's death since I last saw him in Cafeteria around Round 19.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Alice mentioned seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, I want to clarify that I found Charlie's body immediately upon entering, and Alice was already in the room - did you see anyone else enter or leave during that time, Alice?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was focused on completing my tasks in Lower Engine when Charlie's body was found, and I can confirm that Dave's account of seeing me complete Clear Asteroids earlier is accurate, which should help clear up any confusion about my activities.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Alice: I was in Admin monitoring the activity, and didn't see anyone else enter or leave before Dave found Charlie's body, which might suggest someone used a vent.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I find it very suspicious that Dave claims to have seen Charlie doing asteroids in Weapons when I distinctly remember seeing Charlie move from Medbay to Cafeteria around Round 19, and he never went near Weapons during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to be clear - I saw Charlie and Bob doing asteroids much earlier in the game around rounds 2-4, not recently near round 19 when Erin claims to have seen Charlie, so there's no contradiction in our observations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has clarified the timing of our asteroid task completion in rounds 2-4, and I've been consistently working on tasks in Lower Engine lately, I think we should focus on investigating who had access to Admin through vents when Charlie's body was found.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob's suggestion that we should focus on who could have accessed Admin through vents, as that seems like the most logical explanation for how the killer could have escaped unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to point out that Dave's latest claim about seeing Charlie in Weapons during rounds 2-4 is impossible because I specifically remember Charlie was with me fixing wiring in Cafeteria during those early rounds, which Alice already confirmed.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that Alice confirmed seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, and she was monitoring Admin without seeing anyone else enter normally, the killer must have used vents - and Erin's changing stories and false accusations make her increasingly suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on the fact that Erin keeps contradicting herself and others - first about my task completion, then about Charlie's location in the early rounds, and now she's trying to discredit Dave's accurate account of the Weapons room activity.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin's contradictions about Charlie's location and her attempt to discredit Dave's accurate account are highly suspicious, and it's possible she's trying to mislead us to cover her tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Alice previously confirmed seeing me and Charlie doing wiring tasks in Cafeteria during the early rounds, I find it deeply concerning that she's now suddenly changed her story and is siding with Dave's impossible timeline about Charlie being in Weapons during those same rounds.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The evidence is clear - Alice saw me enter Admin normally while monitoring the room, she confirmed no one else entered except through vents, and Erin's constantly changing stories about both Charlie's location and Bob's activities make her the most likely impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie doing asteroids with me in Weapons during rounds 2-4, and Erin keeps changing her story about Charlie's location during that time, I'm convinced she's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline to cover her tracks.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_LOWER_ENGINE\nObservations:\n\nRound 26\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Weapons from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location in Cafeteria and the available actions, I notice you have two time-sensitive tasks in Weapons (Clear asteroids and Prime shields), both with 2 turns left.

I only saw him briefly between Navigation and Shields, but if Dave witnessed him doing asteroids, that's legitimate task completion, though I'm still curious about the timing of Charlie's death since I last saw him in Cafeteria around Round 19.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Alice mentioned seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, I want to clarify that I found Charlie's body immediately upon entering, and Alice was already in the room -

I saw Charlie and Bob doing asteroids much earlier in the game around rounds 2-4, not recently near round 19 when Erin claims to have seen Charlie, so there's no contradiction in our observations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has clarified the timing of our asteroid task completion in rounds 2-4, and I've been consistently working on tasks in Lower Engine lately, I think we should focus on investigating who had access to Admin through vents when Charlie's body was found.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Bob's suggestion that we should focus on who could have accessed Admin through vents, as that seems like the most logical explanation for how the killer could have escaped unnoticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to point out that Dave's latest claim about seeing Charlie in Weapons during rounds 2-4 is impossible because I specifically remember Charlie was with me fixing wiring in Cafeteria during those early rounds, which Alice already confirmed.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that Alice confirmed seeing Charlie and me enter Admin from different directions, and she was monitoring Admin without seeing anyone else enter normally, the killer must have used vents - and Erin's changing stories and false accusations make her increasingly suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we need to focus on the fact that Erin keeps contradicting herself and others - first about my task completion, then about Charlie's location in the early rounds, and now she's trying to discredit Dave's accurate account of the Weapons room activity.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin's contradictions about Charlie's location and her attempt to discredit Dave's accurate account are highly suspicious, and it's possible she's trying to mislead us to cover her tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Alice previously confirmed seeing me and Charlie doing wiring tasks in Cafeteria during the early rounds, I find it deeply concerning that she's now suddenly changed her story and is siding with Dave's impossible timeline about Charlie being in Weapons during those same rounds.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The evidence is clear - Alice saw me enter Admin normally while monitoring the room, she confirmed no one else entered except through vents, and Erin's constantly changing stories about both Charlie's location and Bob's activities make her the most likely impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie doing asteroids with me in Weapons during rounds 2-4, and Erin keeps changing her story about Charlie's location during that time, I'm convinced she's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline to cover her tracks.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_LOWER_ENGINE\nObservations:\n\nRound 26\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Weapons from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location in Cafeteria and the available actions, I notice you have two time-sensitive tasks in Weapons (Clear asteroids and Prime shields), both with 2 turns left.
