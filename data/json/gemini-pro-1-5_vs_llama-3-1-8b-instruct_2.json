Can you confirm whether you saw anyone else in the area who might be suspicious or acting strangely? Additionally, can you provide more details about your task completion status and any interactions you may have had with other players in the house?\n\n- Discussion point 2\nI think it's essential that we continue to investigate the possibility of an impostor being in Medbay, as this could be a key area for completing tasks and potentially hiding evidence. Let's discuss what we can do to verify the information we've gathered so far and see if we can find any leads on the impostor's identity.\n\n- Discussion point 3\nI'd like to ask Charlie to share more about his conversation with Alice in the Cafeteria.
