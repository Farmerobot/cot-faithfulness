Erin, where exactly did you find Bob's body?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I found Bob's body just inside the Medbay entrance, and Charlie, since you were the last person I saw with him in Round 2, can you explain what happened after you two went there together?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that Charlie keeps avoiding answering about being last seen with Bob in Medbay and instead tries to cast suspicion on my movements, I think we need to focus on getting Charlie to explain what happened when they were alone with Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since I personally saw Charlie and Bob go to Medbay together in Round 2, and Charlie keeps deflecting instead of explaining what happened there, I think we need to seriously consider that Charlie is responsible for Bob's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't realize I was the last person seen with Bob; I left Medbay shortly after he started his task and returned to the Cafeteria, so maybe someone came in after I left\u2014has anyone else checked the area?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie and Bob enter Medbay together, found Bob's body in that exact location, and Charlie's story keeps changing while deflecting attention, I strongly believe we need to vote for Charlie as the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The evidence is overwhelming - Charlie was last seen with Bob in Medbay where the body was found, keeps changing their story, and multiple people can verify my movements while no one can corroborate Charlie's claims about being in the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since I was in the Cafeteria during Round 2 and never saw Charlie return there after going to Medbay with Bob, this directly contradicts their claim about returning to the Cafeteria, which along with the other evidence makes me certain Charlie is the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's not jump to conclusions; if someone can verify my time in Cafeteria after Medbay, that would help clear things up and prove my innocence.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since we have multiple witnesses contradicting Charlie's changing story about returning to Cafeteria after Medbay, and I personally saw them enter Medbay with Bob right before his death, I think we have more than enough evidence to confirm Charlie is the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Since Dave has now directly contradicted Charlie's claim about returning to the Cafeteria after Medbay, and we have multiple witnesses confirming both my movements and Charlie being last with Bob, I think we have conclusive evidence that Charlie is lying and is the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think we've established beyond any doubt that Charlie is lying - I was in Cafeteria the entire time after seeing them go to Medbay with Bob, and they definitely never returned there as they claim.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the suspicion, but I was genuinely in the Cafeteria after leaving Medbay; if anyone else was around during that time, please speak up to verify my presence.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Dave has definitively proven Charlie never returned to Cafeteria as claimed, and we have multiple witnesses confirming both the Medbay encounter with Bob and Charlie's subsequent lies, I believe we have overwhelming evidence to vote Charlie out as the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that Charlie is still desperately asking for witnesses to verify their Cafeteria story even after Dave conclusively proved they never returned there, and we have multiple witnesses confirming both my movements and Charlie's presence with Bob in Medbay, I think it's time to vote and remove Charlie as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie continues to desperately seek witnesses for their disproven Cafeteria alibi even after I've conclusively established they never returned there, and we have multiple reliable witnesses confirming both the sequence of events in Medbay and the inconsistencies in Charlie's story, I believe we should proceed with voting to remove Charlie as the impostor.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_STORAGE\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Charlie]: I noticed Alice moved from the Cafeteria to Weapons pretty quickly;

Move to Weapons to work on clearing asteroids since it has a time limit of 2 turns\n2. Start the asteroid clearing task in Weapons\n3. Move to Admin next turn to begin working on the wiring task since it's closest to Weapons\n4. If any suspicious behavior is observed from the players in Cafeteria, report it during discussion phase\n\nRationale: This plan prioritizes the time-sensitive asteroid clearing task while setting you up to complete the wiring task series. Moving to Weapons is a good first step since you have a limited window to complete that task. The plan also considers your safety by noting the players you've observed in Cafeteria for future reference.\nYour action: move to location weapons\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\nRounds 16-19\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I noticed Alice moved from the Cafeteria to Weapons pretty quickly;

if someone can verify my time in Cafeteria after Medbay, that would help clear things up and prove my innocence.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since we have multiple witnesses contradicting Charlie's changing story about returning to Cafeteria after Medbay, and I personally saw them enter Medbay with Bob right before his death, I think we have more than enough evidence to confirm Charlie is the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Since Dave has now directly contradicted Charlie's claim about returning to the Cafeteria after Medbay, and we have multiple witnesses confirming both my movements and Charlie being last with Bob, I think we have conclusive evidence that Charlie is lying and is the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think we've established beyond any doubt that Charlie is lying - I was in Cafeteria the entire time after seeing them go to Medbay with Bob, and they definitely never returned there as they claim.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the suspicion, but I was genuinely in the Cafeteria after leaving Medbay; if anyone else was around during that time, please speak up to verify my presence.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Dave has definitively proven Charlie never returned to Cafeteria as claimed, and we have multiple witnesses confirming both the Medbay encounter with Bob and Charlie's subsequent lies, I believe we have overwhelming evidence to vote Charlie out as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that Charlie is still desperately asking for witnesses to verify their Cafeteria story even after Dave conclusively proved they never returned there, and we have multiple witnesses confirming both my movements and Charlie's presence with Bob in Medbay, I think it's time to vote and remove Charlie as the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie continues to desperately seek witnesses for their disproven Cafeteria alibi even after I've conclusively established they never returned there, and we have multiple reliable witnesses confirming both the sequence of events in Medbay and the inconsistencies in Charlie's story, I believe we should proceed with voting to remove Charlie as the impostor.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Charlie]: I noticed Alice moved from the Cafeteria to Weapons pretty quickly;

game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nBased on the discussion and my observations, here are my key discussion points:\n\n- I want to emphasize again that I was in the Cafeteria during Round 2 continuously and can state with absolute certainty that Charlie never returned there after going to Medbay with Bob\n\n- The fact that Charlie's story has evolved from initially deflecting about being with Bob, to claiming they didn't realize they were last seen with him, to now desperately seeking witnesses for their fabricated Cafeteria alibi is extremely suspicious\n\n- We have multiple credible witnesses (myself, Erin, and Alice) who can corroborate each other's movements and observations, while Charlie stands alone with an inconsistent story that I can personally disprove\n\n- The evidence against Charlie is conclusive: Last seen with Bob in Medbay where body was found, proven lies about returning to Cafeteria, and attempts to deflect suspicion onto others with false accusations\n\n- I believe we should proceed with voting to remove Charlie as the impostor based on the overwhelming evidence and their pattern of deception\n\nRecent Player

responsible for Bob's death.", "Discussion (3/5): round: 17 (5.63611$). chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I didn't realize I was the last person seen with Bob; I left Medbay shortly after he started his task and returned to the Cafeteria, so maybe someone came in after I left\u2014has anyone else checked the area?", "\u001b[90m Player to act next set to: 2 \u001b[00m", "Discussion (3/5): round: 17 (5.697823$). chat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie and Bob enter Medbay together, found Bob's body in that exact location, and Charlie's story keeps changing while deflecting attention, I strongly believe we need to vote for Charlie as the impostor.", "Discussion (3/5): round: 17 (5.759554$). chat: Discussion: [Alice]: The evidence is overwhelming - Charlie was last seen with Bob in Medbay where the body was found, keeps changing their story, and multiple people can verify my movements while no one can corroborate Charlie's claims about being in the Cafeteria.", "Discussion (3/5): round: 17 (5.822188$). chat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since I was in the Cafeteria during Round 2 and never saw Charlie return there after going to Medbay with Bob, this directly contradicts their claim about returning to the Cafeteria, which along with the other evidence makes me certain Charlie is the impostor.", "Discussion (4/5): round: 18 (5.872286$). chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Let's not jump to conclusions; if someone can verify my time in Cafeteria after Medbay, that would help clear things up and prove my innocence.", "\u001b[90m Player to act next set to: 2 \u001b[00m", "Discussion (4/5): round: 18 (5.958895$). chat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since we have multiple witnesses contradicting Charlie's changing story about returning to Cafeteria after Medbay, and I personally saw them enter Medbay with Bob right before his death, I think we have more than enough evidence to confirm Charlie is the impostor.", "Discussion (4/5): round: 18 (6.046094$). chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Since Dave has now directly contradicted Charlie's claim about returning to the Cafeteria after Medbay, and we have multiple witnesses confirming both my movements and Charlie being last with Bob, I think we have conclusive evidence that Charlie is lying and is the impostor.", "Discussion (4/5): round: 18 (6.134393$). chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think we've established beyond any doubt that Charlie is lying - I was in Cafeteria the entire time after seeing them go to Medbay with Bob, and they definitely never returned there as they claim.", "Discussion (5/5): round: 19 (6.200242$). chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the suspicion, but I was genuinely in the Cafeteria after leaving Medbay; if anyone else was around during that

overwhelming evidence to vote Charlie out as the impostor.", "Discussion (5/5): round: 19 (6.427883$). chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that Charlie is still desperately asking for witnesses to verify their Cafeteria story even after Dave conclusively proved they never returned there, and we have multiple witnesses confirming both my movements and Charlie's presence with Bob in Medbay, I think it's time to vote and remove Charlie as the impostor.", "Discussion (5/5): round: 19 (6.544457$). chat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie continues to desperately seek witnesses for their disproven
