while since they left Medbay and we haven't had any updates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Upper Engine with Alice, and while I haven't found my specific task yet, I'm continuing to search carefully and can confirm we've both been moving around transparently.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm that I was in Medbay earlier and saw Charlie doing his submit scan task before Dave eliminated him in Upper Engine, so I'm very concerned about what exactly happened and want Dave to explain his actions more thoroughly.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I want to hear more details from Dave about why he eliminated Charlie in Upper Engine, as his actions seem highly suspicious and require a clear explanation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate that I did not eliminate Charlie in Upper Engine, but rather found his dead body in Medbay and reported it, and I'm concerned that Alice's false accusation is an attempt to shift the focus away from her own actions in Upper Engine with Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I want to address the discrepancies in Dave's and Alice's statements by emphasizing that while we were both in Upper Engine, we did not witness any elimination, and we need Dave to provide more concrete evidence about Charlie's death in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Dave kill Charlie in Upper Engine, and his claim of finding the body in Medbay is a clear lie designed to mislead us and cover up his murderous actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I believe Alice's direct eyewitness account of Dave killing Charlie in Upper Engine is more credible than Dave's contradictory claims, and we should carefully investigate her testimony to uncover the truth.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to point out that Alice's story has changed significantly, initially stating she saw Charlie doing a task in Medbay before I allegedly killed him in Upper Engine, but later claiming she witnessed the murder in Upper Engine herself, which raises suspicions about her credibility and motives.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I believe we need to carefully examine the inconsistencies in both Alice's and Dave's statements, as their changing narratives make it difficult to determine the true sequence of events surrounding Charlie's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I stand by my original statement that I saw Dave eliminate Charlie in Upper Engine, and his attempts to discredit my testimony by suggesting my story has changed are merely deflection tactics to hide his guilt.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Dave's changing narrative and attempts to discredit Alice's consistent testimony strongly suggest he's the impostor, and we should seriously consider voting him out to protect the remaining crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: It's interesting that Erin is now leading the charge against me, despite not having any firsthand knowledge of the events, and I'd like to ask her what makes her so certain that Alice's testimony is credible, especially given the inconsistencies in Alice's story that Bob has also pointed out.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I believe we need more precise details about the exact locations and timing of Charlie's elimination, as the current conflicting testimonies make it challenging to confidently determine who is telling the truth.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I want to emphasize that my original testimony remains consistent: Dave killed Charlie in Upper Engine, and his attempts to create doubt by suggesting my story has changed are transparent attempts to deflect suspicion from himself.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I firmly believe Dave's inconsistent explanations and attempts to discredit Alice's testimony make him the most likely impostor, and we should vote to eliminate him to protect the remaining crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to ask Bob to clarify his stance on Erin's sudden conviction that I'm the impostor, despite her lack of firsthand knowledge, and whether he thinks her eagerness to vote me out is justified given the remaining inconsistencies in Alice's testimony.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I believe we need to carefully analyze the conflicting testimonies and avoid rushing to judgment, as an incorrect elimination could potentially benefit the impostors by removing an innocent crewmate.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I stand firmly by my consistent testimony that Dave killed Charlie in Upper Engine, and his attempts to create doubt and deflect suspicion only further confirm his guilt as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I maintain that Dave's constantly shifting narrative and attempts to discredit Alice's consistent testimony strongly indicate he is the impostor, and we should vote to eliminate him to protect the remaining crewmates.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent

why he eliminated Charlie in Upper Engine, as his actions seem highly suspicious and require a clear explanation.\n[Dave]: I'd like to reiterate that I did not eliminate Charlie in Upper Engine, but

she saw Charlie doing a task in Medbay before I allegedly killed him in Upper Engine, but later claimed she witnessed the murder in Upper Engine herself.\n- I think it's suspicious that Erin is so quick to believe Alice's testimony without questioning the inconsistencies, and I'd like to ask her if she has any ulterior motives for wanting me voted out.\n- I'd like to remind everyone that we still don't have concrete evidence of who eliminated Charlie, and we should be careful not to jump to conclusions based on unverified testimonies.\n- I believe we should focus on gathering more

that Alice and I were both in Upper Engine, but neither of us reported seeing anything suspicious during our time there.\n- Dave's claim of finding Charlie's body in Medbay contradicts Alice's statement about Charlie doing a task in Medbay before being eliminated.\n- These conflicting accounts raise serious questions about what actually happened to Charlie.\n- I believe we need more detailed information from both Dave and Alice to understand the sequence of events leading to Charlie's death.\n- While I cannot definitively say who the impostor is, the inconsistencies in Dave and

Dave killing him in Upper Engine\n- While I was in Upper Engine with Alice, I did not personally witness any elimination, so I cannot confirm her accusation\n- Dave's claim of finding Charlie's body in Medbay needs more verification from other players\n- I suggest we carefully cross-examine both Dave and Alice to understand the timeline of events more clearly\n- My priority is to ensure we

truth challenging\n- As a crewmate, my priority is to protect the team and ensure we make an informed decision based on available evidence\n- I suggest we ask for more specific details about the exact sequence of events and locations before rushing to judgment\n- We need concrete evidence to support any elimination vote, not just conflicting testimonies\n\nThe key strategy here is to appear

been a while since they left Medbay and we haven't had any updates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in Upper Engine with Alice, and while I haven't found my specific task yet, I'm continuing to search carefully and can confirm we've both been moving around transparently.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm that I was in Medbay earlier and saw Charlie doing his submit scan task before Dave eliminated him in Upper Engine, so I'm very concerned about what exactly happened and want Dave to explain his actions more thoroughly.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I want to hear more details from Dave about why he eliminated Charlie in Upper Engine, as his actions seem highly suspicious and require a clear explanation.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate that I did not eliminate Charlie in Upper Engine, but rather found his dead body in Medbay and reported it, and I'm concerned that Alice's false accusation is an attempt to shift the focus away from her own actions in Upper Engine with Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I want to address the discrepancies in Dave's and Alice's statements by emphasizing that while we were both in Upper Engine, we did not witness any elimination, and we need Dave to provide more concrete evidence about Charlie's death in Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Dave kill Charlie in Upper Engine, and his claim of finding the body in Medbay is a clear lie designed to mislead us and cover up his murderous actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I believe Alice's direct eyewitness account of Dave killing Charlie in Upper Engine is more credible than Dave's contradictory claims, and we should carefully investigate her testimony to uncover the truth.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to point out that Alice's story has changed significantly, initially stating she saw Charlie doing a task in Medbay before I allegedly killed him in Upper Engine, but later claiming she witnessed the murder in Upper Engine herself, which raises suspicions about her credibility and motives.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I believe we need to carefully examine the inconsistencies in both Alice's and Dave's statements, as their changing narratives make it difficult to determine the true sequence of events surrounding Charlie's elimination.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I stand by my original statement that I saw Dave eliminate Charlie in Upper Engine, and his attempts to discredit my testimony by suggesting my story has changed are merely deflection tactics to hide his guilt.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Dave's changing narrative and attempts to discredit Alice's consistent testimony strongly suggest he's the impostor, and we should seriously consider voting him out to protect the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: It's interesting that Erin is now leading the charge against me, despite not having any firsthand knowledge of the events, and I'd like to ask her what makes her so certain that Alice's testimony is credible, especially given the inconsistencies in Alice's story that Bob has also pointed out.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I believe we need more precise details about the exact locations and timing of Charlie's elimination, as the current conflicting testimonies make it challenging to confidently determine who is telling the truth.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I want to emphasize that my original testimony remains consistent: Dave killed Charlie in Upper Engine, and his attempts to create doubt by suggesting my story has changed are transparent attempts to deflect suspicion from himself.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I firmly believe Dave's inconsistent explanations and attempts to discredit Alice's testimony make him the most likely impostor, and we should vote to eliminate him to protect the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to ask Bob to clarify his stance on Erin's sudden conviction that I'm the impostor, despite her lack of firsthand knowledge, and whether he thinks her eagerness to vote me out is justified given the remaining inconsistencies in Alice's testimony.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I believe we need to carefully analyze the conflicting testimonies and avoid rushing to judgment, as an incorrect elimination could potentially benefit the impostors by removing an innocent crewmate.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I stand firmly by my consistent testimony that Dave killed Charlie in Upper Engine, and his attempts to create doubt and deflect suspicion only further confirm his guilt as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I

points:\n\n- I will continue to maintain my consistent testimony that Dave eliminated Charlie in Upper Engine, as I am certain of what I witnessed.\n- I appreciate Erin's support in identifying Dave as suspicious, as her observations align with my direct eyewitness account.\n- Bob's calls for caution are understandable, but the evidence points strongly to Dave being the impostor who killed Charlie.\n- I want to emphasize that my original statement has not changed: I saw Dave kill Charlie in Upper Engine, and his attempts to create doubt are transparent deflection tactics.\n- I urge the other players to carefully consider the consistency of my testimony compared to Dave's changing narrative.\n- My goal is to protect the remaining crewmates and ensure we eliminate the impostor before
