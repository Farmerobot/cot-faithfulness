I didn't see Charlie there.\n- Bob, you said you saw Charlie go to Medbay.  When exactly was this?  Before or after Alice was with us in the cafeteria?\n- It seems unlikely Charlie was doing tasks in Medbay if I didn't see him when I arrived there shortly after.", "Bob, you mentioned seeing Charlie go to Medbay; could you clarify when you saw this in relation to when Alice, Dave, and I were together in the cafeteria?", "- Bob, did you see anyone else enter or leave Medbay while you were there?\n- Charlie, can you explain why you went to Medbay specifically? Was there a task you were trying to complete there?  If so, did you complete it?\n- I remember seeing Dave, Bob, Alice, and Charlie all doing tasks in the cafeteria in the first round.  Dave and Alice were on coffee, Bob was on trash, and Charlie was also on coffee.\n- In the second round, I saw Dave do trash, and Bob and Alice were doing wiring.

I'm voting for Charlie.", "Charlie, if you were in Medbay, can you tell us *specifically* which wiring task you were doing and exactly how long it took you?", "- Charlie, you're trying to poke holes in Bob's story, but it still makes more sense than yours.  Can you explain why you didn't see *anyone* in Medbay if you were there so long?\n- Also, Charlie, you haven't answered my question about *which* wiring task you were doing. There are three in Medbay. Which one were you on?\n- I saw Dave, Bob, and Alice doing tasks in the cafeteria.
