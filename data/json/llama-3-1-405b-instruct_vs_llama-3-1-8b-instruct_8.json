I'd like to address Charlie's question about why I think Alice is suspicious: it's because she's been consistently trying to discredit my alibi and create confusion about my actions, which seems like a deliberate attempt to shift attention away from herself.\n- I'd like to ask Charlie if he's noticed anything unusual about Alice's behavior or statements, as he seems to be taking a neutral stance in this discussion, and I value his objective perspective.\n- I'd like to reiterate that I'm still waiting for Alice to provide any evidence or witnesses to support her claim that I was emptying the trash, as her insistence on this point without any concrete evidence is starting to look like a desperate attempt to discredit me.\n- I'd like to suggest that we focus on verifying the alibis of all players, rather than just mine, to ensure that we're not missing any potential impostors, and I'm willing to cooperate fully with any investigation.\n- I'd like to remind everyone that we have only 2 rounds left to discuss before voting, and I think it's essential that we make the most of this time to gather information and make an informed decision about who to eject.\n\nRecent Player
