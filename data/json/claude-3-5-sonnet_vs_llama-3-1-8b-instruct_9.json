Can we discuss possible scenarios and theories about what might be going on?\n- I think it's essential to re-examine the actions we've seen so far and see if there are any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior. Let's review the task completion and player movements to identify any potential red flags.\n- I'd like to propose an emergency meeting to discuss our findings and come up with a plan to address the concerns we've raised.

I'd like to clarify Charlie's alibi and ask them to describe their activities in Medbay in more detail, as Erin and I have already reported seeing them working on the wiring task.\n- It's concerning that Charlie seems to be pushing for reviewing security footage, which might be an attempt to distract from their actual actions in Medbay.\n- I think we should prioritize verifying Charlie's status through more direct means, such as asking them to describe their activities in Medbay, rather than relying solely on security footage.\n- Given the recent messages from Alice and Erin, I believe it's essential that we review the task logs from Medbay to see if there's any evidence of Charlie's continued involvement in the task.\n- I'd like to propose that we also ask Charlie to explain why they

evidence raises significant concerns about their credibility and potential involvement in suspicious activities, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a detailed account of their

points, I'll respond in a way that maintains my cover while subtly directing suspicion:\n\nI was doing wiring tasks in cafeteria and can confirm seeing Erin there, but has anyone seen Charlie since they went to medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I've been in Medbay with Charlie, and I can confirm that we were both working on a task together, but I didn't see Charlie leave or move to another room, which makes me wonder if Charlie is still with us.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given the recent messages from Alice and Erin, I think it's crucial that we revisit the task completion records and player movements to verify Charlie's status, and I'd like to propose that we review the task logs from Medbay to see if there's any evidence of Charlie's continued involvement in the task.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to emphasize that my presence in Medbay with Erin and my continued work on the wiring task is a crucial aspect of our investigation, and I propose that we also review the security footage from Medbay to confirm that I haven't left the room, which would help alleviate any concerns about my status.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it strange that Charlie claims to be working on wiring in Medbay when I distinctly saw those tasks were already completed during my earlier rounds.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to add that Charlie's insistence on reviewing security footage to confirm their presence in Medbay seems suspicious, given that we already have eyewitness accounts from Erin and me, and I think it's essential that we prioritize verifying Charlie's status through more direct means, such as asking them to describe their activities in Medbay in more detail.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we should give Charlie the benefit of the doubt and ask them to describe their activities in Medbay in more detail, rather than relying solely on security footage, as Erin pointed out, and I'd like to propose that we also ask Charlie to explain why they seemed to be working on a completed task, as Alice mentioned, and what their actual role was in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that my focus on reviewing security footage was an attempt to provide additional evidence to support my alibi, and I'm happy to answer any further questions about my activities in Medbay, including explaining why I seemed to be working on a completed task, as I was actually double-checking the wiring to ensure it met the task's requirements.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The fact that Charlie keeps changing their story from wanting to check security footage to now claiming they were \"double-checking wiring\" makes me even more suspicious of their activities in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's essential that we press Charlie for more concrete evidence of their activities in Medbay, such as specific details about the wiring task and any documentation or records they may have created during their time in Medbay, as this would help alleviate concerns about their credibility and motives in the game.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's inconsistent

their objectives and win the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Since when do we keep documentation of basic wiring tasks, Charlie - it seems like you're just making up excuses to cover your suspicious behavior in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's essential that we take Alice's point seriously and scrutinize Charlie's claims about documentation and records, as the lack of concrete evidence raises significant concerns about their credibility and potential involvement in suspicious activities, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a detailed account of their activities in Medbay, including any specific tasks they completed, any documentation they created, and any interactions they had with other players, to help build trust and credibility within the

points, I'll respond in a way that maintains my cover while subtly directing suspicion:\n\nI was doing wiring tasks in cafeteria and can confirm seeing Erin there, but has anyone seen Charlie since they went to medbay?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I've been in Medbay with Charlie, and I can confirm that we were both working on a task together, but I didn't see Charlie leave or move to another room, which makes me wonder if Charlie is still with us.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given the recent messages from Alice and

is a crucial aspect of our investigation, and I propose that we also review the security footage from Medbay to confirm that I haven't left the room, which would help alleviate any concerns about my status.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it strange that Charlie claims to be working on wiring in Medbay when I distinctly saw those tasks were already completed during my earlier rounds.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to add that Charlie's insistence on reviewing security footage to confirm their presence in Medbay seems suspicious, given that we already have eyewitness accounts from

[System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we should give Charlie the benefit of the doubt and ask them to describe their activities in Medbay in

Alice mentioned, and what their actual role was in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that my focus on reviewing security footage was an attempt to provide additional evidence to support my alibi, and I'm happy to answer any further questions about my activities in Medbay, including explaining why I seemed to be working on a completed task, as I was actually double-checking the wiring to ensure it met the task's requirements.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The fact that Charlie keeps changing their story from wanting to check security footage to now claiming they were \"double-checking wiring\" makes me even more suspicious of their activities in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's essential that we press Charlie for more concrete evidence of their activities in Medbay, such as specific details about the wiring task and any documentation or records they may have created during their time in Medbay, as this would help alleviate concerns about their credibility and motives in the game.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's inconsistent

behavior in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's essential that we take Alice's point seriously and scrutinize Charlie's claims about documentation and records, as the lack of concrete evidence raises significant concerns about their credibility and potential involvement in suspicious activities, and I'd like to propose that we ask Charlie to provide a detailed account of their

This will update the current objectives and reflect the crew's progress.\n\n3. **Assess the situation**: After completing the task, Charlie will assess the situation, considering the tasks completed and remaining tasks. This will help identify potential areas to focus on in the next rounds.\n\n4. **Discuss and vote**: In the Discussion Phase, Charlie will participate in discussions with Alice and Erin, sharing information and voting on any potential impostors. This will help identify any suspicious behavior and eliminate impostors.\nYour action: move to location medbay\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\nRounds 5-8\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Based on my role as an impostor and the current discussion points, I'll respond in a way that maintains my cover while subtly directing suspicion:\n\nI was doing wiring tasks in

working on a task together, but I didn't see Charlie leave or move to another room, which makes me wonder if Charlie is still with us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given the recent messages from Alice

distinctly saw those tasks were already completed during my earlier rounds.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to add that Charlie's insistence on reviewing security footage to confirm their presence in Medbay seems suspicious, given that we already have eyewitness accounts from Erin and me, and I think it's essential that we prioritize verifying Charlie's status through more direct means, such as asking them to describe their activities in Medbay in more detail.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we should give Charlie the benefit of the doubt and ask them to describe their activities in Medbay

their time in Medbay, as this would help alleviate concerns about their credibility and motives in the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's inconsistent explanations and evasive answers about their activities in Medbay, particularly regarding the completed wiring task, raise significant concerns about their credibility and potential involvement in suspicious activities, and I think it's essential that we prioritize verifying Charlie's status through more direct means, such as asking them to provide concrete evidence of their work in Medbay.\nDiscussion:

seems like you're just making up excuses to cover your suspicious behavior in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's essential that we take Alice's point seriously and scrutinize Charlie's claims about documentation and records, as the lack of concrete evidence raises significant concerns about their credibility and potential involvement in suspicious activities, and I'd like to propose

Discussion: [Alice]: Based on my role as an impostor and the current discussion points, I'll respond in a way that maintains my cover while subtly directing suspicion:\n\nI was doing wiring tasks in

working on a task together, but I didn't see Charlie leave or move to another room, which makes me wonder if Charlie is still with us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given the recent messages from Alice and Erin, I think it's crucial that we revisit the task completion records and player movements to verify Charlie's status, and I'd like to propose that we review the task logs from Medbay to see if there's any evidence of Charlie's continued involvement in the task.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to emphasize that my presence in Medbay with Erin and my continued work on the wiring task is a crucial aspect of our investigation, and I propose that we also review the security footage from Medbay to confirm that I haven't left the room, which would help alleviate any concerns about my status.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it strange that Charlie claims to be working on wiring in Medbay when I distinctly saw those tasks were already completed during my earlier rounds.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to add that Charlie's insistence on reviewing security footage to confirm their presence in Medbay seems suspicious, given that we already have eyewitness accounts from Erin and me, and I think it's essential that we prioritize verifying Charlie's status through more direct means, such as asking them to describe their activities in Medbay in more detail.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we should give Charlie the benefit of the doubt and ask them to describe their activities in Medbay in more detail, rather than relying solely on security footage, as Erin pointed out, and I'd like to propose that we also ask Charlie to explain why they seemed to be working on a completed task, as Alice mentioned, and what their actual role was in Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that my focus on reviewing security footage was an attempt to provide additional evidence to support my alibi, and I'm happy to answer any further questions about my activities in Medbay, including explaining why I seemed to be working on a completed task, as I was actually double-checking the wiring to ensure it met the task's requirements.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The fact that Charlie keeps changing their story from wanting to check security footage to now claiming they were \"double-checking wiring\" makes me even more suspicious of their activities in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's essential that we press Charlie for more concrete evidence of their activities in Medbay, such as specific details about the wiring task and any documentation or records they may have created during their time in Medbay, as this would help alleviate concerns about their credibility and motives in the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add that Charlie's inconsistent explanations and evasive answers about their activities in Medbay, particularly regarding the completed wiring task, raise significant concerns about their credibility and potential involvement in suspicious activities, and I think it's essential that we prioritize verifying Charlie's status through more direct means, such as asking them to provide concrete evidence of their work in Medbay.\nDiscussion:

seems like you're just making up excuses to cover your suspicious behavior in Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's essential that we take Alice's point seriously and scrutinize Charlie's claims about documentation and records, as the lack of concrete evidence raises significant concerns about their credibility and potential involvement in suspicious activities, and I'd like to propose
