Looking at your objectives and the accessible locations, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1. Move to Electrical - This is a strategic move as it's one of the available paths and can help you explore towards Upper Engine where one of your tasks is located\n2. Watch for any players entering Electrical as it's a potentially dangerous location\n3. Plan to work your way towards O2 in future rounds (where you have two pending tasks) once the path becomes available\n\nThis plan prioritizes:\n- Making progress towards task locations\n- Maintaining safety in high-risk areas\n- Strategic movement through the map\n\nI chose Electrical because it's directly accessible and could provide a path towards Upper Engine where you have a task. While you can't reach O2 or Navigation directly yet, this movement keeps you active and potentially moving towards your objectives.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Storage\n- move to location Electrical\n- move to location Admin\n- move to location
