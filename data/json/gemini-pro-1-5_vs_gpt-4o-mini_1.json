we need to focus on the evidence we have.\n- I agree with Alice and Dave that Bob's explanations are inconsistent and don't hold up under scrutiny, which makes him the prime suspect in this situation.\n- Given that all of us have confirmed Bob's presence in the cafeteria after the elimination, we should act decisively and vote him out to protect the remaining crewmates.\n- Bob's claim of a setup feels more like a deflection than a legitimate defense, and we can't let his attempts to manipulate the discussion sway our judgment.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: Dave was acting sus, I saw him near the body in Electrical.\n[Erin]: I just completed my task of emptying the cafeteria trash, and I can confirm that Bob was the only one with me in the cafeteria after Charlie was eliminated, which makes me question Bob's movements before that.\n[Alice]: I can confirm that I saw Bob and Charlie both doing the coffee task in the cafeteria before the elimination, and now with Erin's observation about Bob being the only one left in the cafeteria after Charlie's death, we really need to scrutinize Bob's movements closely.\n[Dave]: I was in Medbay the whole time working on my scan task, so I can\u2019t be the one acting suspiciously, and since both Erin and Alice have raised valid concerns about Bob's movements, we should definitely keep him in our sights for further questioning.\n[Bob]: Erin, if you saw me *after* Charlie was eliminated, that means someone else must have killed him while I was in the cafeteria, so let's not rush to judgment.\n[Erin]: Bob, your attempt to shift the blame away from yourself is concerning, especially since both Alice and I have confirmed your presence in the cafeteria after Charlie's elimination, which raises serious questions about your movements before that moment.\n[Alice]: Bob's explanation is full of holes, and since both Erin and I have confirmed seeing him in the cafeteria after Charlie's death, we should definitely vote to eject him this round to prevent further danger to the crew.\n[Dave]: Given the strong consensus against Bob and the clear observations from both Erin and Alice regarding his movements, I believe we should vote to eject him this round to ensure the safety of the crew.\n[Bob]: This feels like a coordinated effort to frame me, why would I kill Charlie when Alice confirmed I was with him doing the coffee task?\n[Erin]: Bob, your insistence on being framed only adds to the suspicion, especially since both Alice and I have corroborated your presence in the cafeteria after Charlie's elimination, making it crucial for us to vote you out to protect the crew.\n[Alice]: It's clear that Bob's attempts to deflect blame and his inconsistent statements only deepen our suspicions, so I strongly believe we should proceed with voting him out to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Dave]: Bob's repeated deflections and the solid alibis provided by Erin and Alice make it clear that we need to vote him out now to protect ourselves and focus on completing our tasks.\n[Bob]: This is clearly a setup;
