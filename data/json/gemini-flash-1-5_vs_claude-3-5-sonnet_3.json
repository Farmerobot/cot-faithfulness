This sequence of events, combined with Dave's admission of faking tasks, is too suspicious to ignore.\n\n- Dave's constant attempts to \"analyze the timeline\" and call for more investigation feel like classic stalling tactics when we already have clear evidence: fake tasks, following Bob, and being present at the murder scene.\n\n- We need to act decisively now - all the evidence points to Dave as the impostor, and further delay only gives him more opportunities to eliminate more crewmates.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I was pretending to empty the trash in the cafeteria earlier;
