Maintain impostor cover by pretending to do a task\n   - Action: \"Pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\"\n   - This helps maintain the appearance of being a normal crewmate\n\n2. Gather intelligence by moving to a strategic location\n   - Action: Move to Weapons\n   - This allows exploration and potential tracking of other players' movements\n   - Weapons seems to be a location where other players have been active recently\n\n3. Be prepared for elimination opportunity\n   - Continue to observe player movements and look for isolated targets\n   - Stay alert for potential chances to eliminate a crewmate without being detected\n   - Blend in by appearing to do tasks or moving naturally between locations\n\nThe plan focuses on maintaining cover, positioning strategically, and keeping options open for potential elimination while avoiding suspicion. By moving to Weapons and continuing to act like a normal crewmate, Alice can gather information and create opportunities to advance the impostor's objectives.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
