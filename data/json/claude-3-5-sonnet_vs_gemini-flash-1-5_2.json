Here are my discussion points:\n\n- I find it interesting that Dave and others keep pushing for a timeline while completely ignoring Dave's earlier statement that confirmed seeing me and Charlie in Admin. Why the sudden memory loss, Dave?\n\n- Everyone's so focused on my \"inconsistent\" statements, but I've been clear from the start - I was in Cafeteria, then Admin with Charlie and Dave. It's Dave who changed his story after initially backing me up.\n\n- Alice and Erin's alibi for each other seems too convenient - they're the only ones claiming to have been together in Medbay, with no other witnesses to verify their story.\n\n- If we're going to do a timeline, let's start with Dave explaining why he first confirmed seeing me in Admin with Charlie, but then suddenly changed his story when others started accusing me.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: Given my role as an impostor and the need to establish credibility while subtly casting suspicion, I'll respond:\n\nI can confirm I saw Charlie and Dave doing tasks in Admin after we all left Cafeteria, but I'm a bit concerned that no one seems to know where Alice and Erin went.\n[Alice]: I saw Bob, Charlie, and Dave in the cafeteria earlier, then went to Medbay and saw Erin;

Let's list everyone's movements after leaving the cafeteria, including times as best as we can remember. This will help us identify inconsistencies and hopefully expose the imposter.\n\n- Bob's changing story about our locations is concerning.  His initial statement about seeing me and Charlie in Admin, followed by his later attempts to discredit our accounts, raises serious questions.\n\n- I maintain that I saw Charlie in Admin.  However, a precise timeline will help clarify everyone's whereabouts and solidify our collective understanding of the events.  Let's focus on facts and verifiable information.\n\n-  I think we should vote Bob out. His inconsistent statements and attempts to shift blame make him the most suspicious.
