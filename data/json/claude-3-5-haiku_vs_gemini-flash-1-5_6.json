Move to Reactor\n   - After completing the fake task, move to Reactor\n   - This will help create distance from the elimination site\n   - Changing locations quickly can make tracking the elimination more difficult\n\n4. Assess next elimination target\n   - In Reactor, observe other players' movements\n   - Look for another isolated or vulnerable crewmate to potentially eliminate in the next round\n\nThe plan focuses on taking advantage of the current opportunity with Alice, maintaining my cover, and continuing to strategically reduce the number of crewmates.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
