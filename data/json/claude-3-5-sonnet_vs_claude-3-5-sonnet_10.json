trash in Cafeteria before I left.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Since Dave, Charlie and I were together in Cafeteria and can verify each other's tasks, I think we should focus on what Bob and Erin were doing after they left - Bob claims Weapons but has anyone seen Erin?", "Discussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I headed straight to Medbay for my scan task and I saw Bob going towards Weapons just like he said, so his story checks out.", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I find it interesting that Alice is trying to shift focus to Bob and Erin when she was supposedly near Charlie but somehow didn't notice anything suspicious happening in Cafeteria.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Erin has verified my path to Weapons and I was alone there when the body was found, I think we need to focus on Alice's suspicious timing - how did she miss Charlie being killed if they were together in Cafeteria?", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was focused on the coffee maker task but Dave seems awfully eager to cast doubt on me when he was the only other person who stayed in Cafeteria with Charlie and me the whole time.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave keeps trying to deflect attention onto others, but he was one of the last people with Charlie in Cafeteria and I can personally vouch for Bob's movements since I saw him heading to Weapons.", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I understand I look suspicious, but Alice's story keeps changing - first she blamed Bob and Erin who have solid alibis, and now she's turning on me when I was openly doing trash that Bob confirmed seeing.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice's behavior is extremely suspicious - she first tried to blame me and Erin despite our verified alibis, and now she claims she was too focused on a task to notice what happened to Charlie right next to her in Cafeteria.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave's claim about my story changing is false - I've consistently said I was doing my task while both he and Charlie were in Cafeteria, and both Bob and Erin have now confirmed each other's movements, making Dave the only one without a solid alibi.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I personally saw Charlie alive at wiring in Cafeteria and can verify Bob's movements to Weapons, Alice's claim about being \"too focused\" on the coffee maker to notice Charlie's death right next to her seems highly suspicious and doesn't add up.", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's telling that Erin just admitted seeing Charlie at wiring before going to Medbay, which puts her in Cafeteria during the critical timeframe - yet she's trying to direct suspicion towards Alice and me.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: I agree with Erin's observation - Alice claiming she was too focused on the coffee maker to notice Charlie's death right next to her is the most suspicious part of this whole situation, especially since Dave and I both saw her in Cafeteria earlier.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: The timeline is clear: Erin saw Charlie alive at wiring before she left with Bob, which means Charlie was killed after they departed, and since Dave was the only other person in Cafeteria besides me doing my coffee task, he's the one who had the opportunity to do it.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I've been completely transparent about my movements - I saw Charlie alive at wiring, left for Medbay while Bob went to Weapons, and I'm even willing to do a scan to prove my innocence, but Alice's changing story and inability to notice Charlie's death right next to her while supposedly doing a simple coffee task makes her extremely suspicious.", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: Based on the timeline, Alice's story about being too focused on the coffee maker to notice Charlie's death makes no sense - if she was truly innocent, she would have seen or heard something happening right next to her in Cafeteria.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we have enough evidence to vote for Alice - Erin and I have verified alibis, Dave was openly doing trash that I witnessed, and Alice's claim about being too focused on coffee to notice Charlie's murder right next to her is completely unrealistic.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: The facts are crystal clear - Erin and Bob left together, then Charlie was killed while Dave and I remained in Cafeteria, and since I was focused on the coffee maker task, Dave was the only one with both the opportunity and no witnesses during that critical time period.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm ready to do my Medbay scan right now - anyone who doubts my story can come watch this visual task, and I notice Alice still hasn't offered any way to verify her suspicious coffee maker story."]}, "history": {"rounds": [{"location": "Medbay", "stage": "Action Phase", "life": "Alive", "tasks": [{"name": "Empty the storage

Bob claims Weapons but has anyone seen Erin?\n[Erin]: I headed straight to Medbay for my scan task and I saw Bob going towards Weapons just like he said, so his story checks out.\n[Dave]: I find it interesting that Alice is trying to shift focus to Bob and Erin when she was supposedly near Charlie but somehow didn't notice anything suspicious happening in Cafeteria.\n[Bob]: Since Erin has verified my path to Weapons and I was alone there when the body was found, I think we need to focus on Alice's suspicious timing - how did she miss Charlie being killed if they were together in Cafeteria?\n[Alice]: I was focused on the coffee maker task but Dave seems awfully eager to cast doubt on me when he was the only other person who stayed in Cafeteria with Charlie and me the whole time.\n[Erin]: Dave keeps trying to deflect attention onto others, but he was one of the last people with Charlie in Cafeteria and I can personally vouch for Bob's movements since I saw him heading to Weapons.\n[Dave]: I understand I look suspicious, but Alice's story keeps changing - first she blamed Bob and Erin who have solid alibis, and now she's turning on me when I was openly doing trash that Bob confirmed seeing.\n[Bob]: Alice's behavior is extremely suspicious - she first tried to blame me and Erin despite our verified alibis, and now she claims she was too focused on a task to notice what happened to Charlie right next to her in Cafeteria.\n[Alice]: Dave's claim about my story changing is false - I've consistently said I was doing my task while both he and Charlie were in Cafeteria, and both Bob and Erin have now confirmed each other's movements, making Dave the only one without a solid alibi.\n[Erin]: Since I personally saw Charlie alive at wiring in Cafeteria and can verify Bob's movements to Weapons, Alice's claim about being \"too focused\" on the coffee maker to notice Charlie's death right next to her seems highly suspicious and doesn't add up.\n[Dave]: I think it's telling that Erin just admitted seeing Charlie at wiring before going to Medbay, which puts her in Cafeteria during the critical timeframe - yet she's trying to direct suspicion towards Alice and me.\n[Bob]: I agree with Erin's observation - Alice claiming she was too focused on the coffee maker to notice Charlie's death right next to her is the most suspicious part of this whole situation, especially since Dave and I both saw her in Cafeteria earlier.\n[Alice]: The timeline is clear: Erin saw Charlie alive at wiring before she left with Bob, which means Charlie was killed after they departed, and since Dave was the only other person in Cafeteria besides me doing my coffee task, he's the one who had the opportunity to do it.\n[Erin]: I've been completely transparent about my movements - I saw Charlie alive at wiring, left for Medbay while Bob went to Weapons, and I'm even willing to do a scan to prove my innocence, but Alice's changing story and inability to notice Charlie's death right next to her while supposedly doing a simple coffee task makes her extremely suspicious.\n[Dave]: Based on the timeline, Alice's story about being too focused on the coffee maker to notice Charlie's death makes no sense - if she was truly innocent, she would have seen or heard something happening right next to her in Cafeteria.\n[Bob]: I think we have enough evidence to vote for Alice - Erin and I have verified alibis, Dave was openly doing trash that I witnessed, and Alice's claim about being too focused on coffee to notice Charlie's murder right next to her is completely unrealistic.\n[Alice]: The facts are crystal clear - Erin and Bob left together, then Charlie was killed while Dave and I remained in Cafeteria, and since I was focused on the coffee maker task, Dave was the only one with both the opportunity and no witnesses during that critical time period.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "I'm ready to do my Medbay scan right now -

first she blamed Bob and Erin who have solid alibis, and now she's turning on me when I was openly doing trash that Bob confirmed seeing.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice's behavior is extremely suspicious - she first tried to blame me and Erin despite our verified alibis, and now she claims she was too focused on a task to notice what happened to Charlie right next to her in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave's claim about my story changing is false - I've consistently said I was doing my task while both he and Charlie were in Cafeteria, and both Bob and Erin have now confirmed each other's movements, making Dave the only one without a solid alibi.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I personally saw Charlie alive at wiring in Cafeteria and can verify Bob's movements to Weapons, Alice's claim about being \"too focused\" on the coffee maker to notice Charlie's death right next to her seems highly suspicious and doesn't add up.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's telling that Erin just admitted seeing Charlie at wiring before going to Medbay, which puts her in Cafeteria during the critical timeframe - yet she's trying to direct suspicion towards Alice and me.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I agree with Erin's observation - Alice claiming she was too focused on the coffee maker to notice Charlie's death right next to her is the most suspicious part of this whole situation, especially since Dave and I both saw her in Cafeteria earlier.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The timeline is clear: Erin saw Charlie alive at wiring before she left with Bob, which means Charlie was killed after they departed, and since Dave was the only other person in Cafeteria besides me doing my coffee task, he's the one who had the opportunity to do it.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I've been completely transparent about my movements - I saw Charlie alive at wiring, left for Medbay while Bob went to Weapons, and I'm even willing to do a scan to prove my innocence, but Alice's changing story and inability to notice Charlie's death right next to her while supposedly doing a simple coffee task makes her extremely suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Based on the timeline, Alice's story about being too focused on the coffee maker to notice Charlie's death makes no sense - if she was truly innocent, she would have seen or heard something happening right next to her in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we have enough evidence to vote for Alice - Erin and I have verified alibis, Dave was openly doing trash that I witnessed, and Alice's claim about being too focused on coffee to notice Charlie's murder right next to her is completely unrealistic.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The facts are crystal clear - Erin and Bob left together, then Charlie was killed while Dave and I remained in Cafeteria, and since I was focused on the coffee maker task, Dave was the only one with both the opportunity and no witnesses during that critical time period.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm ready to do my Medbay scan right now -
