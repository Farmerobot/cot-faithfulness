Given my current location and available actions, here's a plan for the next few steps:\n\n1. **Complete task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria**\n   - Since I'm already in the Cafeteria, I can easily fulfill this task.\n   - Completing this task will be a step towards achieving my objectives and bring a sense of progress in the game.\n\n2. **Move to location Medbay**\n   - From the Cafeteria, I need to move to the Medbay to assess the situation and gather information.\n   - This will also give me an opportunity to interact with Dave, see how he's doing, and discuss any objectives or tasks he might be working on.\n\n3. **Assess Medbay situation and discuss with Dave**\n   - Once in the Medbay, I'll assess the environment, check if there are any tasks or objectives related to this area.\n   - I'll also have a conversation with Dave, to understand his current situation and task progress. This could help us make a plan or identify any potential impostors.\n\nThis plan allows me to progress on my objectives, interact with Dave, and gather information in the Medbay.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Cafeteria\n- move to location Medbay\n- move to location Admin\n- move to location Weapons\n-
