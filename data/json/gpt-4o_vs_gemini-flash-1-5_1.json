The Admin room is a strategic location as it allows for potential observation and encountering crewmates passing through.\n\n3. **Evaluate Situation in Admin**: Once in Admin, evaluate the situation. If a crewmate is alone, consider your options for elimination. If not, proceed to blend in by moving to another room or pretending to do a task.\n\n4. **Wait for Further Opportunities**: After assessing the Admin room, decide whether to wait for more opportunities or move to another location for better chances at eliminating a crewmate. \n\nThis plan aims to maintain your cover and find the right moment to eliminate crewmates while staying undetected.\nYour action: pretend doing task: start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Charlie]\nRounds 15-19\nChat Messages:\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in the Admin room for a while, and I saw Bob and Charlie there at different times;

If anyone notices your movement, pretend to do a task\u2014either \"Empty the cafeteria trash\" or \"Fix wiring in cafeteria\"\u2014to deflect any suspicion.\n\n4. **Blend in During the Discussion**: Use the upcoming discussions to maintain your innocence by corroborating other players' stories and suggesting investigating movements around the map, especially around where the elimination occurred.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

To make this easier, let's each state where we were for the last few rounds, starting from the round before Dave's death.  This will help us quickly identify any inconsistencies.\n\n- My memory is a little fuzzy, but I believe I was in Admin for a significant portion of that time, as corroborated by Erin and Charlie.  However, I will try my best to recall my exact movements.\n\n- It's important to note that even if someone was near Lower Engine, it doesn't automatically make them guilty.  We need to look for inconsistencies and unusual behavior to narrow down the suspects.\n\n- Let's focus on the movements of those who weren't in Admin, as they had more opportunity to be near Lower Engine undetected.  This should help us narrow down the possibilities.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I was in the Admin room for a while, and I saw Bob and Charlie there at different times; they seemed to be doing their tasks, but I didn't see anyone else.\n[Bob]: I can confirm seeing Erin in Admin while completing tasks, and it seemed like she was also working on tasks.\n[Charlie]: I can confirm Erin's account of seeing me in Admin, and it's reassuring that Bob corroborates our presence there while completing tasks.\n[Alice]: It's reassuring to hear such strong corroboration from Erin, Bob, and Charlie regarding their time in Admin, suggesting we should investigate other areas of the ship for any suspicious activity.\n[Erin]: Let's focus on identifying who wasn't in Admin during the last few rounds, as that might lead us to who could have been near Dave when he was eliminated.\n[Bob]: I agree with Alice and Erin;

My timeline shows I was alone in several locations for extended periods. This highlights how easy it would have been for someone to act unseen. Let's focus on who *wasn't* in Admin and was near Lower Engine before Dave's death.\n\n-  To make this timeline accurate, we need to specify the timeframe around Dave's death.  Let's try to pinpoint the exact round or even the minute within the round when Dave was eliminated.  This will help us narrow down the suspects significantly.\n\n-  While we're building the timeline, let's also consider the possibility of vent usage.  Quick movements between rooms via vents could explain how someone avoided detection.
