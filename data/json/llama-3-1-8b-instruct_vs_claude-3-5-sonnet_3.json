If Bob seems suspicious or is completing tasks that could be beneficial to the crewmates, I may consider eliminating them.\n3. **Wait for a safe opportunity to move and strike**: If I don't have an opportunity to eliminate Bob in the next step, I'll wait until I can safely move to the Medbay and complete my objective.

No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Medbay\n- report dead body of Bob\n- move to location Upper Engine\n- move to location Cafeteria\n- pretend doing task: Fix wiring in medbay\nPlease note that at the moment you can not go anywhere else than listed in actions.\n\nCurrent Location:\nMedbay\nPlayers currently in Room with you:\n\n\nCreate a plan with 3-4 steps.\n", "\nYou are Alice in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Impostor\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- wait in Medbay\n- report dead body of Bob\n- move to location Upper Engine\n- move to location Cafeteria\n- pretend doing task: Fix wiring in medbay\n\nPlanned Steps:\nBased on the current situation, my plan as the Impostor is as follows:\n\n1. **Wait in Medbay**: I will stay in the Medbay, pretending to do nothing, and observe if any other crewmates enter the room. This will allow me to keep an eye on Bob, who is already in the room, and see if there are any opportunities to strike.\n2. **Report dead body of Bob (if Bob is caught by me)**: If Bob gets into a situation where I can kill him without being seen, I will report his dead body to the game. This will make it seem like Bob was the one eliminated, and the crewmates will not suspect me.\n3. **Move to location Upper Engine (if safe to do so)**: If I have not been detected and I have a safe opportunity to escape the Medbay, I will move to the Upper Engine. This will put me in a strategic location to observe the crewmates and wait for another chance to eliminate an unsuspecting target.\n4. **Wait for the next opportunity to strike**: I will continue to observe the situation and wait for the next opportunity to strike. This may involve pretending to do tasks or mixing with the crewmates, all while keeping a close eye on potential targets.\n\nThis plan will keep me safe for now, while also allowing me to observe the situation and wait for the perfect moment to eliminate a crewmate.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
