Let's focus on verifying the times involved.  Bob, can you give a more precise timeframe for when you were in Medbay?  What time did you enter and leave?\n-  We need to cross-reference Bob's timeline with everyone else's to see if there are any discrepancies.  Let's each state when we were in Medbay and the surrounding areas.\n-  It's important to remember that impostors can fake tasks.  While we've seen some tasks completed, that doesn't eliminate suspicion from anyone.\n-  Let's propose a plan to systematically search the remaining rooms and compare notes afterwards to see if we can find any inconsistencies or overlooked clues.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I was just in the cafeteria and saw Dave and Bob working on tasks, but when I went to grab a cup of coffee, they were gone - does anyone know where they are now?\n[Alice]: I can confirm seeing Dave and Bob in the cafeteria earlier, working on tasks, and then went to Admin to fix the wiring, so it's strange they disappeared so quickly.\n[Charlie]: I also saw Dave and Bob in the cafeteria earlier, and their disappearance after Alice went to Admin is very suspicious;

My account is accurate: I completed the scan in Medbay, a quick task, and left immediately.  I didn't see Dave.  Perhaps focusing on establishing a complete timeline for everyone's movements, beyond just my Medbay visit, will be more productive in finding the imposter.\n\n- To help build that timeline, can we review where everyone was in the moments leading up to Dave's death?  Knowing everyone's locations will help eliminate possibilities and identify potential inconsistencies.\n\n-  While I understand the suspicion, accusing me based solely on proximity to the body isn't sufficient evidence.  Let's work together to gather more information before jumping to conclusions.
