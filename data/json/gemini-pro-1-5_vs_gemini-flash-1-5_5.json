Let's stick to the facts.\n-  My suggestion to focus on the asteroid clearing task completion times is a verifiable way to check alibis and identify inconsistencies.  Let's do that before jumping to conclusions.\n-  Alice's claim that Charlie and I are working together is unfounded.  We're both suggesting a logical approach to finding the imposter.\n-  Let's review the times for the asteroid clearing task.  Who completed it, and when?  This will help us eliminate possibilities.\n-  If we can establish a clear timeline based on task completion times, we can more easily identify any discrepancies in location reports.\n\nRecent Player
