Bob was at the coffee maker, Charlie was doing wiring, and Alice was at the coffee maker before she died\n- Bob's false claim about Erin going to Navigation is extremely suspicious, especially since three of us (me, Charlie, and Erin herself) can confirm she went to Weapons\n- The fact that Alice died shortly after I saw her at the coffee maker, and Bob was also near the coffee maker, makes me very suspicious of Bob\n- I think we should vote for Bob -
