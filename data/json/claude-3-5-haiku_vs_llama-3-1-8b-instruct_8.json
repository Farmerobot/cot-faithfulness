I was in Medbay and saw multiple players doing tasks like Dave and Bob submitting scans.\n- I noticed Alice and Charlie moved around quite a bit between Medbay and Upper Engine, which seems suspicious. I'll subtly draw attention to their movement.\n- I want to create doubt about other players' movements without drawing too much attention to myself.\n- I'll suggest we discuss task completion progress and try to identify who might be slacking or moving suspiciously.\n- My goal is to blend in and redirect suspicion away from myself while keeping other players uncertain about each other.\n\nPotential strategic discussion points:\n- \"I was in Medbay earlier and saw Dave and Bob completing their scans.

I'll subtly draw attention to their movement.\n- I want to create doubt about other players' movements without drawing too much attention to myself.\n- I'll suggest we discuss task completion progress and try to identify who might be slacking or moving suspiciously.\n- My goal is to blend in and redirect suspicion away from myself while keeping other players uncertain about each other.\n\nPotential strategic discussion points:\n- \"I was in Medbay earlier and saw Dave and Bob completing their scans.

Who was near Dave before his death?\n- Bob, since you reported the body, can you tell us exactly where and when you found Dave?\n- We should be careful about jumping to conclusions too quickly.

This seems like a coordinated effort to put me on the defensive.\n\n- Alice seems particularly eager to keep questioning me, which is suspicious. Why is she so intent on drawing attention to my testimony?\n\n- I noticed that while everyone is talking about Dave, no one is discussing the actual tasks or progress we've made on the ship. This could be a deliberate distraction tactic.\n\n- Charlie and Bob are both pressing me for more details, which feels like they're trying to corner me. Their synchronized questioning seems rehearsed.\n\n- I think we should broaden our discussion. Instead of fixating on Dave, we should talk about what each person was doing and where they were when the incident occurred.\n\n- Alice's insistence on Dave's \"avoidance of eye contact\" seems like a weak argument. Is this really grounds for suspicion, or is she trying to create doubt?\n\nMy strategy is to cast doubt on Alice's motives, create confusion about the current narrative, and avoid being pinned down by specific questions while subtly suggesting that others might be hiding something.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I was in Medbay earlier and saw Dave and Bob completing their scans.

Are they arguing or showing unusual behavior?\n\n3. **Prepare for potential alternative actions**: If Alice sees something suspicious or if she needs to investigate further, she can prepare to move to location Upper Engine or Cafeteria if necessary.\n\n4. **Re-evaluate the situation after observing Charlie and Bob**: After waiting and observing, Alice can reassess the situation and make a more informed decision about her next move.
