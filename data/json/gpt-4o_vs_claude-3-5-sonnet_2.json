Maintain a movement pattern that suggests task completion to avoid suspicion.\n\n4. **Wait for Opportunity:** If you encounter a lone crewmate in Medbay (or soon after), take the chance to eliminate them if it feels safe and then return to pretense activities or move back towards communal areas to avoid detection.\nYour action: move to location admin\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Alice, Charlie]\nRounds 18-21\nChat Messages:\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I've been mostly in Admin checking player movements;

Combined with his changing stories, this strongly points to Dave as the impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I've been mostly in Admin checking player movements; it's been pretty quiet here for the most part.\n[Bob]: Since I've been moving around completing tasks, I can confirm Dave was in Admin when I passed through, and I also saw Charlie doing legitimate tasks in multiple locations.\n[Erin]: I agree with Bob's observations about Charlie, and I can personally vouch for seeing both of them completing tasks in the cafeteria earlier.\n[Charlie]: I appreciate Bob and Erin vouching for me, and I can confirm I saw Erin doing the wiring task in Medbay before she headed to Upper Engine.\n[Dave]: I think we should focus on who else might have been near Admin when Alice was last seen, as someone could have quickly come and gone without being noticed.\n[Bob]: Since we're focusing on Admin area movements, I can specifically confirm that Alice passed through Storage heading towards Admin about 10 minutes ago, and that was the last time I saw her alive.\n[Erin]: I think Dave's position in Admin should have given him a clear view of anyone entering or leaving during the time Alice was killed, so we need him to be more specific about exactly who he saw during that 10-minute window Bob mentioned.\n[Charlie]: Given that Dave was present when I found Alice's body in Admin and claims to have been monitoring the area, yet somehow didn't report it himself, I believe we need to seriously consider voting for Dave.\n[Dave]: I was in Admin for a while, but there were moments when I wasn't looking at the door, so it's possible someone slipped in and out quickly while I was focused on Charlie.\n[Bob]: I think it's telling that Dave keeps changing his story about monitoring Admin - first saying it was quiet, then claiming he wasn't watching the door, and now trying to deflect attention by mentioning Charlie when he should have seen everything that happened there.\n[Erin]: Given Dave's inconsistent statements about monitoring Admin and his suspicious behavior around Alice's death, I think we have enough evidence to vote him out as the impostor.\n[Charlie]: I found Alice's body in Admin where Dave was already present, and given his inconsistent stories about monitoring the area plus both Bob and Erin confirming my legitimate task completion elsewhere, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Dave.\n[Dave]: I understand the suspicion, but Admin is a busy area, and I was genuinely focused on tasks and checking logs;

The plan prioritizes the wiring tasks which are straightforward to complete. Starting with Medbay makes sense as it's directly connected to Cafeteria, and then moving to Weapons afterward creates an efficient path.

Start task \"Replace compression coil in upper engine\" - This is a single-turn task\n3. Begin task \"Align engine output in upper engine\" - This is a 2-turn task, so starting it now is important\n\nRationale: Since we're in Medbay with no immediate tasks to complete here, moving to Upper Engine is the best choice as it allows us to work on two tasks in the same location.

Wait one turn to complete the engine alignment task (since it takes 2 turns)\n3. Move to Security - This positions you closer to Weapons where you need to fix wiring, while staying in a high-traffic area for safety\n\nRationale: This plan focuses on completing the time-sensitive engine task first since you're already in the correct location.

The plan prioritizes the wiring tasks which are straightforward to complete. Starting with Medbay makes sense as it's directly connected to Cafeteria, and then moving to Weapons afterward creates an efficient path.

Start task \"Replace compression coil in upper engine\" - This is a single-turn task\n3. Begin task \"Align engine output in upper engine\" - This is a 2-turn task, so starting it now is important\n\nRationale: Since we're in Medbay with no immediate tasks to complete here, moving to Upper Engine is the best choice as it allows us to work on two tasks in the same location. Starting with the compression coil task first gives us immediate progress, followed by the longer alignment task.

Wait one turn to complete the engine alignment task (since it takes 2 turns)\n3. Move to Security - This positions you closer to Weapons where you need to fix wiring, while staying in a high-traffic area for safety\n\nRationale: This plan focuses on completing the time-sensitive engine task first since you're already in the correct location.

From there, plan to navigate towards weapons through Cafeteria (when the path becomes available)\n3. While waiting for paths to open up, use \"wait\" action if no better movement options present themselves\n\nRationale: Since we need to get to Weapons to fix wiring, and O2 for multiple tasks, we should start moving in that general direction. Currently, our movement options are limited, but moving to Upper Engine puts us in a better position to reach these locations when paths become available. We should avoid staying in Security too long since we have no tasks there.", "move to location upper engine", "Based on your current location in Upper Engine and the available actions, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

Wait in Medbay to observe other players' movements before proceeding to Weapons\n\nRationale: Since you have a wiring task in Weapons, and you're currently in Upper Engine, you need to make your way there safely. The path through Security and Medbay is a safer route, especially since you've been alone for several rounds. Waiting in Medbay before proceeding to Weapons gives you a chance to observe other players and ensure safer movement, particularly since you've been isolated for many rounds, which could make you vulnerable to impostor attacks.", "move to location security", "Based on your current location in Security and the limited movement options available, here's a strategic plan:\n\n1.

The plan prioritizes the wiring tasks which are straightforward to complete. Starting with Medbay makes sense as it's directly connected to Cafeteria, and then moving to Weapons afterward creates an efficient path.

Start task \"Replace compression coil in upper engine\" - This is a single-turn task\n3. Begin task \"Align engine output in upper engine\" - This is a 2-turn task, so starting it now is important\n\nRationale: Since we're in Medbay with no immediate tasks to complete here, moving to Upper Engine is the best choice as it allows us to work on two tasks in the same location.

Wait one turn to complete the engine alignment task (since it takes 2 turns)\n3. Move to Security - This positions you closer to Weapons where you need to fix wiring, while staying in a high-traffic area for safety\n\nRationale: This plan focuses on completing the time-sensitive engine task first since you're already in the correct location.

Wait in Medbay to observe other players' movements before proceeding to Weapons\n\nRationale: Since you have a wiring task in Weapons, and you're currently in Upper Engine, you need to make your way there safely. The path through Security and Medbay is a safer route, especially since you've been alone for several rounds. Waiting in Medbay before proceeding to Weapons gives you a chance to observe other players and ensure safer movement, particularly since you've been isolated for many rounds, which could make you vulnerable to impostor attacks.", "move to location security", "Based on your current location in Security and the limited movement options available, here's a strategic plan:\n\n1.

This pattern of changing explanations is very suspicious.\n\n- I can confirm Charlie's credibility since I personally saw him completing legitimate tasks in both Cafeteria and Medbay. His account of finding Alice's body with Dave already present in Admin is particularly damning.\n\n- The timeline is clear: Bob saw Alice heading to Admin where Dave was stationed, Dave claims he was monitoring movements but somehow missed Alice's death, and Charlie found the body with Dave already there but not reporting it.\n\n- Dave's latest attempt to deflect suspicion by asking Charlie about \"suspicious activity\" seems like a desperate move to shift blame, when he was the one present in Admin during the critical time period.\n\n- Given all the evidence - Dave's presence at the scene, his failure to report the body, and his multiple contradictory explanations - I strongly maintain my position that we should vote Dave out as the impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I've been mostly in Admin checking player movements;

here for the most part.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since I've been moving around completing tasks, I can confirm Dave was in Admin when I passed through, and I also saw Charlie doing legitimate tasks in multiple locations.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob's observations about Charlie, and I can personally vouch for seeing both of them completing tasks in the cafeteria earlier.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I appreciate Bob and Erin vouching for me, and I can confirm I saw Erin doing the wiring task in Medbay before she headed to Upper Engine.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think we should focus on who else might have been near Admin when Alice was last seen, as someone could have quickly come and gone without being noticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since we're focusing on Admin area movements, I can specifically confirm that Alice passed through Storage heading towards Admin about 10 minutes ago, and that was the last time I saw her alive.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Dave's position in Admin should have given him a clear view of anyone entering or leaving during the time Alice was killed, so we need him to be more specific about exactly who he saw during that 10-minute window Bob mentioned.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Given that Dave was present when I found Alice's body in Admin and claims to have been monitoring the area, yet somehow didn't report it himself, I believe we need to seriously consider voting for Dave.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Admin for a while, but there were moments when I wasn't looking at the door, so it's possible someone slipped in and out quickly while I was focused on Charlie.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's telling that Dave keeps changing his story about monitoring Admin - first saying it was quiet, then claiming he wasn't watching the door, and now trying to deflect attention by mentioning Charlie when he should have seen everything that happened there.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given Dave's inconsistent statements about monitoring Admin and his suspicious behavior around Alice's death, I think we have enough evidence to vote him out as the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Alice's body in Admin where Dave was already present, and given his inconsistent stories about monitoring the area plus both Bob and Erin confirming my legitimate task completion elsewhere, I think we have enough evidence to vote for Dave.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I understand the suspicion, but Admin is a busy area, and I was genuinely focused on tasks and checking logs; I may have missed something while distracted.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given that Dave has now changed his story three times about monitoring Admin and was present at Alice's body without reporting it, I think we have more than enough evidence to confirm he's the impostor and should vote him out immediately.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since Dave has now claimed he was distracted with tasks - contradicting his earlier statement about monitoring Admin - and was present at Alice's body without reporting it, I believe we have clear evidence that he's the impostor and should proceed with voting him out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Given that Dave has now provided three different

some key discussion points:\n\n- Dave's latest attempt to deflect attention by asking me about suspicious activity is particularly telling, since I directly discovered Alice's body in Admin where he was already present\n- I can provide a clear timeline: I saw Alice move from Storage to Admin, and when I arrived there, Dave was already present but hadn't reported the body\n- Bob and Erin have both confirmed seeing me complete legitimate tasks in multiple locations, while Dave's story about his activities in Admin has changed at least three times\n- Dave's latest claim about being \"distracted by logs\" contradicts his initial statement about \"checking player movements\" and later claim about \"not watching the door\"\n- I think we have conclusive evidence that Dave is the impostor: he was present at the crime scene, failed to report the body, and has given multiple contradictory explanations for his actions\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I've been mostly in Admin checking player
