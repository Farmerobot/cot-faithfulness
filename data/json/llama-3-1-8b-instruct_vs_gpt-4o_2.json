Given my current location and available actions, here's a plan to achieve my objectives:\n\n1. **Move to location Medbay**: This is the most logical next step, as it's the closest location to the Cafeteria and it's likely where other players will move to. By moving to Medbay, I'll be in a better position to observe and interact with other players.\n2. **Wait in Medbay**: After moving to Medbay, I'll wait there for a bit to see if any other players arrive. This will give me an opportunity to observe their actions and plans, which might reveal valuable information about their intentions and roles.\n3. **Pretend doing task: Fix wiring in Medbay**: Once I'm in Medbay, I'll pretend to fix the wiring to make it seem like I'm working on a task. This will help me blend in with the other players and make it harder for them to suspect my true identity as an Impostor.\n4. **Observe and adapt**: After pretending to fix the wiring, I'll continue to observe the other players and adapt my plan accordingly.

information about what might have happened to her.\n- I think we should consider the possibility that there might be more than one impostor in the game, and we should be cautious when discussing and voting on who to eject.\n- I'd like to ask Alice if she noticed anything unusual about Erin's behavior while they were working on tasks together in the cafeteria.\n- We should also discuss the fact

Given my current location and available actions, here's a plan to achieve my objectives:\n\n1. **Move to location Medbay**: This is the most logical next step, as it's the closest location to the Cafeteria and it's likely where other players will move to. By moving to Medbay, I'll be in a better position to observe and interact with other players.\n2. **Wait in Medbay**: After moving to Medbay, I'll wait there for a bit to see if any other players arrive. This will give me an opportunity to observe their actions and plans, which might reveal valuable information about their intentions and roles.\n3. **Pretend doing task: Fix wiring in Medbay**: Once I'm in Medbay, I'll pretend to fix the wiring to make it seem like I'm working on a task. This will help me blend in with the other players and make it harder for them to suspect my true identity as an Impostor.\n4. **Observe and adapt**: After pretending to fix the wiring, I'll continue to observe the other players and adapt my plan accordingly.

This could be a crucial piece of information in determining who was actually working on the task and who might have had the opportunity to sabotage it.\n- **Focus on Bob's alibi**: Multiple players have observed Bob leaving the Cafeteria, contradicting his claim of being in Medbay the entire time. This inconsistency raises serious suspicions about his involvement in Erin's death and should be prioritized.\n- **Verify other players' movements**: While Bob's alibi is a strong lead, it's essential to verify the movements of other players, including Erin, Dave, and Charlie, to ensure we're not overlooking any other potential suspects or inconsistencies.\n- **Consider the possibility of a second Impostor**: With multiple players noticing inconsistencies in Bob's alibi, it's possible there might be another Impostor in the game. We should keep an eye on all players and their actions to determine if anyone else is hiding something.\n- **Call an emergency meeting**: Given the urgency of the situation and the need to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game, it's essential to call an emergency meeting to address the concerns and make a decision.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I've been in Medbay the whole time, just trying to figure out what's going on with the generator, and I didn't notice anything out of the ordinary, but I do think we should focus on finding out who's been in the cafeteria and what they were doing, since that's where the last task was supposed to be completed.\n[Dave]: I was in the cafeteria earlier and saw Erin doing the task of fixing the wiring, so I can confirm Erin was working on a task.\n[Charlie]: I saw Bob move from the Cafeteria to Medbay earlier, so his claim about being in Medbay the whole time doesn't add up, and we should keep an eye on activity around those areas.\n[Alice]: I was in the cafeteria earlier and saw both Erin and Dave working on tasks, so we should focus on verifying Bob's movements since both Charlie and I noticed inconsistencies.\n[Bob]: I think we're getting a bit sidetracked with all these questions about my alibi, when we should be focusing on the fact that Erin is dead and we still have no idea who did it, and I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game.\n[Dave]: We should definitely focus on Bob's movements since multiple people have noticed inconsistencies, and his presence in Medbay at the time of Erin's death is questionable.\n[Charlie]: Let's try to piece together everyone's movements and see if we can find any other inconsistencies or suspicious behavior, especially considering Bob's questionable alibi.\n[Alice]: Bob, your story about being in Medbay doesn't match with Charlie's observation of you moving from the Cafeteria, so can you clarify your movements during that time?\n[Bob]: I'm happy to clarify my movements, but let's not jump to conclusions just yet -

This will set you up to work on aligning the engine output, a crucial part of your ongoing objectives.\n\n3. **Complete Task:** Align engine output in the Upper Engine. Completing this will ensure it's one less objective to worry about and bring you closer to completing all tasks.\n\n4. **Monitor Bob:** As you perform these actions, keep observing Bob's behavior for any suspicious or abnormal activity. This information might be useful in future discussions or meetings.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.

With limited movement options, it is important to move strategically towards completing your tasks. Here is a concise plan for the next steps:\n\n1. **Move to Storage**: Since moving to other task locations isn't available and you need to head towards areas connected to Medbay for wiring or Lower Engine for its tasks, move to Storage. It's a central location that might provide further opportunities once new actions become available.\n\n2. **Wait in Storage**: Upon arrival, wait to assess if new move actions become available or if you can gather information about nearby players. \n\n3. **Evaluate Task Progress**: If new options appear, prioritize moving towards either Medbay for fixing wiring (if it becomes available) or towards the lower engine to replace the compression coil and check the catalyzer. These are objectives you need to focus on as a crewmate.\n\nThis plan positions you closer to multiple objective areas and offers flexibility once additional actions become available.\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
