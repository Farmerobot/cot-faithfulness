to clarify, my movements were primarily focused on completing tasks in Admin, Storage, and Electrical, with minimal time spent in other areas.  I can provide more specific times once we establish a common timeframe for the events surrounding Bob's disappearance.\n\n- To help with the timeline, I'll add that I was alone in Admin, Storage, and Electrical for the majority of the time I was in those rooms. This should help eliminate any potential overlaps or inconsistencies.\n\n-  Let's focus on corroborating the information provided by Erin and Alice.  If their timelines are accurate and consistent, it might help us narrow down potential suspects.  I'm happy to help cross-reference my own movements against theirs.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I think it's a good idea for us to review the task list and prioritize the ones that haven't been started yet, to make sure we're covering all our bases.\n[Dave]: I agree with Charlie, and to help prioritize, I've completed tasks in Admin, Storage, and Electrical;

This allows observation of other players and proximity to potential tasks.\n2. **Complete task:**  If available in Admin, begin working on  `Download Data` or `Calibrate Distributor`.\n3. **Move to location:** Medbay (if no Admin tasks are available). Since Medbay was mentioned in the discussion as a crucial location, investigating this area should be a priority after checking Admin.\n4. **Assess the situation:** Observe player activities in Medbay and decide on next action.
