it's the most objective way to assess everyone's movements around Erin's death.  Let's focus on verifiable actions and task completion times.\n\n- My task in Weapons would have taken a significant amount of time, making it impossible for me to leave and participate in Erin's elimination.  I'm open to providing more details about my task if needed.\n\n-  I think it's important to note that Alice only reported Erin's body; she didn't witness the elimination.  This weakens her accusations.\n\n- Let's avoid making assumptions and focus on verifiable facts.  The timeline will help us determine who is being truthful.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I think it's a bit suspicious that Bob moved to Medbay so quickly, does anyone know what they're doing there?\n[Dave]: I saw Bob leave the cafeteria for Medbay, but I was busy with tasks and didn't notice anything unusual;
