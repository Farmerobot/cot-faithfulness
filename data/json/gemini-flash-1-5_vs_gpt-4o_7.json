This consistency in our accounts strengthens the credibility of our observations.\n- Alice's failure to report Dave's elimination immediately and the lack of specific details in her account raise significant doubts about her story. If she truly witnessed such a critical event, it's puzzling why she delayed reporting it.\n- Given the consistency between Erin's activities and my observations, alongside Charlie's confirmation, Alice's accusation appears to be an attempt to divert attention. Her claim lacks the necessary evidence to be credible.\n- Alice's suggestion that our coordinated defense could be a cover-up is an interesting point, but the consistency in our accounts suggests otherwise. Our observations align independently, which is unlikely if we were colluding.\n- To ensure we have a complete picture, I propose we review everyone's movements and alibis during the time of the incident, but based on current evidence, Alice's accusation doesn't hold up.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I was in the cafeteria both rounds, and while I didn't see anything suspicious, Alice seemed unusually focused on the trash task \u2013 can anyone corroborate that?\n[Bob]: I can confirm that I saw Erin doing the task Empty the cafeteria trash when I was in the Cafeteria.\n[Charlie]: I can confirm Bob's statement;
