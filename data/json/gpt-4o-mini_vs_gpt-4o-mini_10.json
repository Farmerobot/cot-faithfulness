rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I noticed Erin has been taking quite a while with her task in the cafeteria, which seems a bit suspicious, and I think we should keep an eye on her while we discuss who else might be lurking around Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in Weapons just now, and since I didn't see anyone else around, it makes me wonder about everyone's whereabouts\u2014let's make sure to share our alibis to figure out who might be acting suspiciously.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm that Erin was indeed doing her task in the cafeteria alongside me and Dave, so I think we should focus our attention on Charlie, who was alone in Weapons and could have had the chance to act without witnesses.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I think your comments about Erin seem off since Alice and I can confirm she was with us the whole time, so maybe we should consider if your intention is to deflect suspicion from yourself instead.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate the confirmations about Erin, but we can\u2019t overlook the fact that Charlie was alone in Weapons, which gives him a strong opportunity to have taken out Erin without anyone noticing, so we should definitely keep him in our sights.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns about my location, but let's focus on the fact that both Alice and Dave were with Erin in the cafeteria, which makes Bob's sudden shift in suspicion towards me seem more like a deflection; we need to clarify everyone's movements during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Charlie that Bob's sudden shift in suspicion towards him seems like a deflection, and it\u2019s crucial we all clarify our movements to piece together the timeline accurately.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, your attempts to shift the blame onto Charlie after being the last one with Erin are highly suspicious, and I believe we should vote you out to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: It\u2019s concerning that everyone is so quick to focus on me when Alice and Dave were also in the cafeteria; if we don\u2019t scrutinize their movements, we might miss the real impostor hiding in plain sight.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I appreciate the confirmations from Alice and Dave about Erin, and Bob's deflection raises serious concerns; I propose we vote on Bob to eliminate this growing threat to our team.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I believe that voting out Bob is our best course of action, as his attempts to redirect suspicion onto Charlie and his inconsistent narratives only serve to confuse us and distract from the real threat he poses.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, your continuous deflection and attempts to shift the blame onto others only confirm our suspicions, and voting you out is the most logical step to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I find it alarming that Alice and Dave are so eager to vote me out without critically examining their own actions; let's not rush into a decision when we could be overlooking the real impostor among us.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's constant deflection and attempts to shift blame onto others only serve to highlight his guilt, and I firmly believe that voting him out is essential for our safety as crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I strongly believe we should proceed with voting Bob out, as his ongoing deflection and attempts to redirect suspicion onto others only confirm our collective concerns about his guilt.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, your consistent deflection and attempts to shift blame onto others have made it clear that you pose a threat to our team, and it's time we act decisively by voting you out to protect the remaining crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I understand the pressure is on me, but before we rush to a decision, let's take a moment to reevaluate everyone's movements, especially considering that Charlie had the perfect opportunity to act unnoticed while alone in Weapons.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's continued attempts to redirect the conversation back to my location only serve to highlight his desperation; we need to trust the solid alibis provided by Alice and Dave, and vote him out before he can cause more harm.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I believe it's clear that Bob's constant attempts to deflect blame onto others only serve to highlight his guilt, and with the strong alibis from Erin, Dave, and myself, we must vote him out to ensure the safety of our crew.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, your ongoing deflection and

opportunity to follow her and create an alibi while keeping an eye on her actions.\n- Erin has been in the cafeteria for a while; I should mention that her task seems to be taking longer than expected, which might raise some suspicion.\n- I should also keep an eye on Dave, as he moved to Medbay as well; it could be useful to see if he interacts with Alice or if anything suspicious happens there. \n- If a body is found, I can claim I was busy with the coffee maker task the whole time and suggest that we focus on the players who were in Medbay.", "I noticed Erin has been taking quite a

to be the impostor. \n- Charlie's alibi is a bit shaky since he was alone in Weapons, and it seems like he\u2019s trying to divert attention away from himself.\n- Since I reported the body, I think it

cafeteria. They could have easily collaborated to cover for each other.\n- I find it interesting that Charlie is trying to deflect attention away from himself by putting the spotlight on me. It's a classic tactic to divert suspicion.\n- Erin has been mentioned a lot, but no one has truly questioned Alice's or Dave's movements. They could be using Erin as a shield while they plot.\n- I suggest we discuss more about what Alice and Dave were doing while I was supposedly \"last seen\" with Erin. Their alibis need to be scrutinized too.\n- If we vote me out based on circumstantial evidence, we might just be handing the win to the impostors.

deflect attention from themselves.\n- Charlie's alibi about being alone in Weapons is indeed concerning, but we should also question why Alice and Dave are so eager to vote me out without considering their own actions.\n- Instead of focusing solely on me, we should take a closer look at the dynamics between Alice and Dave; they were together in the cafeteria and could have easily collaborated.\n- I suggest we gather more information about everyone's movements instead of rushing to a vote; there's still time to observe and discuss before making a decision.\n- If we vote me out, we might be

we need to clarify everyone's movements during that time.\n[Alice]: I agree with Charlie that Bob's sudden shift in suspicion towards him seems like a deflection, and it\u2019s crucial we all clarify our movements to piece together the timeline accurately.\n[Dave]: Bob, your attempts to shift the blame onto Charlie after being the last one with Erin are highly suspicious, and I believe we should vote you out to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\n[Bob]: It\u2019s concerning that everyone is so quick to focus on me when Alice and Dave were also in the cafeteria;

we discuss who else might be lurking around Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in Weapons just now, and since I didn't see anyone else around, it makes me wonder about everyone's whereabouts\u2014let's make sure to share our alibis to figure out who might be acting suspiciously.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm that Erin was indeed doing her task in the cafeteria alongside me and Dave, so I think we should focus our attention on Charlie, who was alone in Weapons and could have had the chance to act without witnesses.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I think your comments about Erin seem off since Alice and I can confirm she was with us the whole time, so maybe we should consider if your intention is to deflect suspicion from yourself instead.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate the confirmations about Erin, but we can\u2019t overlook the fact that Charlie was alone in Weapons, which gives him a strong opportunity to have taken out Erin without anyone noticing, so we should definitely keep him in our sights.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns about my location, but let's focus on the fact that both Alice and Dave were with Erin in the cafeteria, which makes Bob's sudden shift in suspicion towards me seem more like a deflection; we need to clarify everyone's movements during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Charlie that Bob's sudden shift in suspicion towards him seems like a deflection, and it\u2019s crucial we all clarify our movements to piece together the timeline accurately.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, your attempts to shift the blame onto Charlie after being the last one with Erin are highly suspicious, and I believe we should vote you out to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: It\u2019s concerning that everyone is so quick to focus on me when Alice and Dave were also in the cafeteria; if we don\u2019t scrutinize their movements, we might miss the real impostor hiding in plain sight.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I appreciate the confirmations from Alice and Dave about Erin, and Bob's deflection raises serious concerns; I propose we vote on Bob to eliminate this growing threat to our team.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I believe that voting out Bob is our best course of action, as his attempts to redirect suspicion onto Charlie and his inconsistent narratives only serve to confuse us and distract from the real threat he poses.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, your continuous deflection and attempts to shift the blame onto others only confirm our suspicions, and voting you out is the most logical step to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I find it alarming that Alice and Dave are so eager to vote me out without critically examining their own actions; let's not rush into a decision when we could be overlooking the real impostor among us.\nchat:

crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I strongly believe we should proceed with voting Bob out, as his ongoing deflection and attempts to redirect suspicion onto others only confirm our collective concerns about his guilt.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, your consistent deflection and attempts to shift blame onto others have made it clear that you pose a threat to our team, and it's time we act decisively by voting you out to protect the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I understand the pressure is on me, but before we rush to a decision, let's take a moment to reevaluate everyone's movements, especially considering that Charlie had the perfect opportunity to act unnoticed while alone in Weapons.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's continued attempts to redirect the conversation back to my location only serve to highlight his desperation; we need to trust the solid alibis provided by Alice and Dave, and vote him out before he can cause more harm.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I believe it's clear that Bob's

fact that both Alice and Dave were with Erin in the cafeteria, which makes Bob's sudden shift in suspicion towards me seem more like a deflection; we need to clarify everyone's movements during that time.\n[Alice]: I agree with Charlie that Bob's sudden shift in suspicion towards him seems like a deflection, and it\u2019s crucial we all clarify our movements to piece together the timeline accurately.\n[Dave]: Bob, your attempts to shift the blame onto Charlie after being the last one with Erin are highly suspicious, and I believe we should vote you out to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\n[Bob]: It\u2019s concerning that everyone is so quick to focus on me when Alice and Dave were also in the cafeteria; if we don\u2019t scrutinize their movements, we might miss the real impostor hiding in plain sight.\n[Charlie]: I appreciate the confirmations from Alice and Dave about Erin, and Bob's deflection raises serious concerns; I propose we vote on Bob to eliminate this growing threat to our team.\n[Alice]: I believe that voting out Bob is our best course of action, as his attempts to redirect suspicion onto Charlie and his inconsistent narratives only serve to confuse us and distract from the real threat he poses.\n[Dave]: Bob, your continuous deflection and attempts to shift the blame onto others only confirm our suspicions, and voting you out is the most logical step to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\n[Bob]: I find it alarming that Alice and Dave are so eager to vote me out without critically examining their own actions; let's not rush into a decision when we could be overlooking the real impostor among us.\n[Charlie]: Bob's constant deflection and attempts to shift blame onto others only serve to highlight his guilt, and I firmly believe that voting him out is essential for our safety as crewmates.\n[Alice]: I strongly believe we should proceed with voting Bob out, as his ongoing deflection and attempts to redirect suspicion onto others only confirm our collective concerns about his guilt.\n[Dave]: Bob, your consistent deflection and attempts to shift blame onto others have made it clear that you pose a threat to our team, and it's time we act decisively by voting you out to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Bob]: I understand the pressure is on me, but before we rush to a decision, let's take a moment to reevaluate everyone's movements, especially considering that Charlie had the perfect opportunity to act unnoticed while alone in Weapons.\n[Charlie]: Bob's continued attempts to redirect the conversation back to my location only serve to highlight his desperation; we need to trust the solid alibis provided by Alice and Dave, and vote him out before he can cause more harm.\n[Alice]: I believe it's clear that Bob's constant attempts to deflect blame onto others only serve to highlight his guilt, and with the strong alibis from Erin, Dave, and myself, we must vote him out to ensure the safety of our crew.\n[Dave]: Bob, your ongoing deflection and attempts to shift the blame onto others only strengthen our resolve to vote you out, as we need to prioritize the safety of the remaining crewmates.\n\nAvailable Voting Options:\n- vote for Nobody\n- vote for Bob\n- vote for Charlie\n- vote for Alice\n\nNote that you should NOT vote for Erin as they are already out of the

for the discussion phase.\n\n3. **After waiting, prepare to discuss** - Use the insights you've gained during your wait to discuss with other players and identify any suspicious behavior when the discussion phase starts. \n\n4. **Plan next move based on discussion outcome** - Depending on the flow of information and if any players get eliminated or tasks remain, decide whether to move to Medbay or Admin to continue completing tasks.\nYour action: complete task: start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Alice]\nRounds 4-7\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I noticed Erin has been taking quite a while with her task in the cafeteria, which seems a bit suspicious, and I think we should keep an eye on her while we discuss who else might be lurking around Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in Weapons just now, and since I didn't see anyone else around, it makes me wonder about everyone's whereabouts\u2014let's make sure to share our alibis to figure out who might be acting suspiciously.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I can confirm that Erin was indeed doing her task in the cafeteria alongside me and Dave, so I think we should focus our attention on Charlie, who was alone in Weapons and could have had the chance to act without witnesses.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I think your comments about Erin seem off since Alice and I can confirm she was with us the whole time, so maybe we should consider if your intention is to deflect suspicion from yourself instead.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate the confirmations about Erin, but we can\u2019t overlook the fact that Charlie was alone in Weapons, which gives him a strong opportunity to have taken out Erin without anyone noticing, so we should definitely keep him in our sights.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns about my location, but let's focus on the fact that both Alice and Dave were with Erin in the cafeteria, which makes Bob's sudden shift in suspicion towards me seem more like a deflection; we need to clarify everyone's movements during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I agree with Charlie that Bob's sudden shift in suspicion towards him seems like a deflection, and it\u2019s crucial we all clarify our movements to piece together the timeline accurately.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, your attempts to shift the blame onto Charlie after being the last one with Erin are highly suspicious, and I believe we should vote you out to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: It\u2019s concerning that everyone is so quick to focus on me when Alice and Dave were also in the cafeteria; if we don\u2019t scrutinize their movements, we might miss the real impostor hiding in plain sight.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I appreciate the confirmations from Alice and Dave about Erin, and Bob's deflection raises serious concerns; I propose we vote on Bob to eliminate this growing threat to our team.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I believe that voting out Bob is our best course of action, as his attempts to redirect suspicion onto Charlie and his inconsistent narratives only serve to confuse us and distract from the real threat he poses.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, your continuous deflection and attempts to shift the blame onto others only confirm our suspicions, and voting you out is the most logical step to ensure the safety of the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I find it alarming that Alice and Dave are so eager to vote me out without critically examining their own actions; let's not rush into a decision when we could be overlooking the real impostor among us.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Bob's constant deflection and attempts to shift blame onto others only serve to highlight his guilt, and I firmly believe that voting him out is essential for our safety as crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I strongly believe we should proceed with voting Bob out, as his ongoing deflection and attempts to redirect suspicion onto others only confirm our collective concerns about his guilt.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, your consistent deflection and attempts to shift blame onto others have made it

being the last one with Erin are highly suspicious; we need to stay focused on the facts and not let his deflection confuse us.\n- With Alice and I confirming Erin's presence in the cafeteria, it\u2019s clear Bob is trying to mislead us; voting him out is the logical step to ensure our safety.\n- Charlie makes a valid point about Bob's desperation to redirect suspicion; we should trust the alibis provided by Alice and myself to make an informed decision.\n- We can't overlook how Bob is the only one with a motive to deflect suspicion; his narrative is inconsistent and serves only to protect himself.
