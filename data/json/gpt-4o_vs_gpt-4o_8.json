Can you recall if anyone else was around or if you noticed any vent sounds or movements?\n- Alice, since you were in Admin for a while, did you happen to notice any patterns in who was using the vents, or any sudden disappearances that might suggest vent activity?\n- I think it's important to consider the timeline Erin mentioned. If Charlie was in Weapons shortly before being found in Admin, we need to identify who could have moved quickly between these areas.\n- Let's focus on who might have had the opportunity to move between Admin and Weapons using the vents.
