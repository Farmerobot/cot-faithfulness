explain this discrepancy, and tell us where you were during rounds 2, 3, and 4 while I was in Admin.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, I saw you *start* trash, leave, then return later, and Bob & Charlie may have only seen us *together* later, so my statement remains accurate; where were *you*, Bob and Charlie, rounds 2-6?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, your story about Alice is crumbling; if you saw her leave Cafeteria, then where were you during rounds 2-6, specifically rounds 3 and 4 when Charlie and I were with Erin in Medbay before finding her body?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's changing story about Alice at trash and his inability to account for rounds 3-4 when the rest of us have clear alibis makes him our most likely suspect.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, your attempt to reframe your story about seeing me leave Cafeteria is weak, and you still haven't addressed your missing alibi for rounds 2-6, especially rounds 3 and 4 when Bob and Charlie were in Medbay with Erin.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob and Charlie, you're both focusing on me, but neither of *you* has explained what you were doing in Medbay with Erin for two whole rounds before finding her body.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave,  your continued deflection about Alice's location and your missing alibi for rounds 2-6, especially 3 and 4 when Erin was killed, strongly suggests your guilt.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since Dave seems desperate to cast doubt on the Medbay situation, let me clarify again that Bob, Erin, and I were all performing legitimate tasks there - I watched Bob's scan and Erin's diagnostics myself - so Dave's attempt to make this suspicious only highlights his own lack of alibi for those critical rounds.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, your deflection tactics are failing; explain your whereabouts during rounds 2-6, specifically 3 and 4, or we vote you out.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob and Charlie, if you were all doing tasks in Medbay, why did none of you report seeing Erin complete *any* of hers?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, Erin was running diagnostics, a lengthy task she couldn't complete while also doing shorter tasks, and we found her body two rounds later, so your question about her completing other tasks is a blatant attempt to distract from your still-missing alibi for rounds 2-6.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's desperate focus on Medbay tasks is telling - I personally witnessed both Bob's scan and Erin's diagnostics work, yet Dave keeps questioning activities he wasn't even present to observe while still failing to account for his own whereabouts during those critical rounds.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, your increasingly desperate attempts to deflect suspicion onto Bob and Charlie only reinforce your guilt; vote Dave.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: So, Bob and Charlie, you both watched Erin start a long diagnostic but neither of you saw her finish it before finding her body two rounds later?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, you're fixated on Erin's diagnostics, but we've explained multiple times it's a multi-round task, and you still haven't provided an alibi for rounds 2-6, especially 3 & 4 when we were in Medbay with Erin;

watched Bob's scan and Erin's diagnostics myself - so Dave's attempt to make this suspicious only highlights his own lack of alibi for those critical rounds.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, your

diagnostics, a lengthy task she couldn't complete while also doing shorter tasks, and we found her body two rounds later, so your question about her completing other tasks is a blatant attempt to distract from your still-missing alibi for rounds 2-6.", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's desperate focus on Medbay tasks is telling - I personally witnessed both Bob's scan and Erin's diagnostics work, yet Dave keeps questioning activities he wasn't even present to observe while still failing to account for his own whereabouts during those critical rounds.", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave,

explain this discrepancy, and tell us where you were during rounds 2, 3, and 4 while I was in Admin.\n[Dave]: Alice, I saw you *start* trash, leave, then return later, and Bob & Charlie may have only seen us *together* later, so my statement remains accurate; where were *you*, Bob and Charlie, rounds 2-6?\n[Bob]: Dave, your story about Alice is crumbling; if you saw her leave Cafeteria, then where were you during rounds 2-6, specifically rounds 3 and 4 when Charlie and I were with Erin in Medbay before finding her body?\n[Charlie]: Dave's changing story about Alice at trash and his inability to account for rounds 3-4 when the rest of us have clear alibis makes him our most likely suspect.\n[Alice]: Dave, your attempt to reframe your story about seeing me leave Cafeteria is weak, and you still haven't addressed your missing alibi for rounds 2-6, especially rounds 3 and 4 when Bob and Charlie were in Medbay with Erin.\n[Dave]: Bob and Charlie, you're both focusing on me, but neither of *you* has explained what you were doing in Medbay with Erin for two whole rounds before finding her body.\n[Bob]: Dave,  your continued deflection about Alice's location and your missing alibi for rounds 2-6, especially 3 and 4 when Erin was killed, strongly suggests your guilt.\n[Charlie]: Since Dave seems desperate to cast doubt on the Medbay situation, let me clarify again that Bob, Erin, and I were all performing legitimate tasks there - I watched Bob's scan and Erin's diagnostics myself - so Dave's attempt to make this suspicious only highlights his own lack of alibi for those critical rounds.\n[Alice]: Dave, your deflection tactics are failing; explain your whereabouts during rounds 2-6, specifically 3 and 4, or we vote you out.\n[Dave]: Bob and Charlie, if you were all doing tasks in Medbay, why did none of you report seeing Erin complete *any* of hers?\n[Bob]: Dave, Erin was running diagnostics, a lengthy task she couldn't complete while also doing shorter tasks, and we found her body two rounds later, so your question about her completing other tasks is a blatant attempt to distract from your still-missing alibi for rounds 2-6.\n[Charlie]: Dave's desperate focus on Medbay tasks is telling - I personally witnessed both Bob's scan and Erin's diagnostics work, yet Dave keeps questioning activities he wasn't even present to observe while still failing to account for his own whereabouts during those critical rounds.\n[Alice]: Dave, your increasingly desperate attempts to deflect suspicion onto Bob and Charlie only reinforce your guilt;
