If others are present, pretend doing task in Reactor to maintain cover\n3. If elimination successful, move to Security to create distance from the scene.

If a single crewmate appears, eliminate them.

Precise times are difficult, but general location and task completion around the time of Alice's death will be helpful.\n- I saw Bob in Medbay working on a task.  Can anyone corroborate this?  This helps establish a solid alibi for both of us during that time.\n-  Charlie's accusation against Erin is serious, but we need more concrete evidence than \"vague responses.\"  Let's focus on verifiable information before jumping to conclusions.\n-  I propose we each briefly state our location and activities in the 5-10 minutes before and after the body was found.

tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it very suspicious that Bob claims to have been in Upper Engine where I just found Alice's body, and I actually saw Erin leaving that area right before discovering it.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: While Bob and I were together in Medbay, I haven't seen him since, but Erin's account of seeing him near the Upper Engine needs further clarification from Charlie regarding the precise timing of events.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: While I was near the Upper Engine earlier, I can't give a precise time, but I was focused on my tasks and didn't see Alice's body.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate the concern regarding my proximity to the Upper Engine, but I was there completing tasks *before* the body was discovered, and I can confirm seeing Alice in Medbay earlier; can anyone corroborate her movements after that?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should focus on Erin's vague timeline and inability to account for their movements near Upper Engine - it's particularly suspicious given that I saw them leaving just moments before finding Alice's body.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Bob's suggestion to focus on Alice's movements after she left Medbay;  can we establish a clearer timeline of everyone's whereabouts before and after the body was discovered to eliminate any inconsistencies?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Dave's suggestion to focus on establishing a timeline of everyone's movements, and I'll do my best to provide more detail about my location around the time Alice's body was discovered.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: To clarify the timeline, can anyone confirm seeing Alice after she left Medbay, and what were their locations before and after the discovery of her body?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The evidence is clear - Erin left Upper Engine moments before I found Alice's body, and their vague responses about their timeline only make them more suspicious compared to Bob's detailed account.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Let's prioritize confirming Alice's movements after leaving Medbay;  precise timelines from everyone regarding their location before and after the discovery are crucial for eliminating

I was in Medbay with Dave, then Upper Engine and Reactor.  My tasks took me to those locations.\n-  Let's focus on getting a complete timeline from everyone.  If we can pinpoint Alice's movements after Medbay, it will help us eliminate the inconsistencies.\n- I saw Alice in Medbay earlier.  Who else saw her after that?  Precise times are crucial here.\n-  Charlie's accusation is based on proximity, not concrete evidence. I was in the Upper Engine *before* the body was discovered.\n-  Erin's lack of a precise timeline is concerning, but let's not jump to conclusions until we have a complete picture.

establishes my presence and creates openings for future suspicion:\n\nI've been doing my tasks in various rooms and noticed Bob and Dave have been unusually quiet - has anyone seen them recently?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Medbay and then the Engine Room completing tasks, and I saw Bob in Medbay earlier also working on a task.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm seeing Dave in Medbay earlier, and it's helpful that Bob was also there according to Dave, which helps account for their whereabouts.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can corroborate Dave's statement; we were together in Medbay for an extended period completing a scan, then I went to the Upper Engine and Reactor to finish my tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I find it very suspicious that Bob claims to have been in Upper Engine where I just found Alice's body, and I actually saw Erin leaving that area right before discovering it.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: While Bob and I were together in Medbay, I haven't seen him since, but Erin's account of seeing him near the Upper Engine needs further clarification from Charlie regarding the precise timing of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: While I was near the Upper Engine earlier, I can't give a precise time, but I was focused on my tasks and didn't see Alice's body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate the concern regarding my proximity to the Upper Engine, but I was there completing tasks *before* the body was discovered, and I can confirm seeing Alice in Medbay earlier; can anyone corroborate her movements after that?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should focus on Erin's vague timeline and inability to account for their movements near Upper Engine - it's particularly suspicious given that I saw them leaving just moments before finding Alice's body.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Bob's suggestion to focus on Alice's movements after she left Medbay;  can we establish a clearer timeline of everyone's whereabouts before and after the body was discovered to eliminate any inconsistencies?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Dave's suggestion to focus on establishing a timeline of everyone's movements, and I'll do my best to provide more detail about my location around the time Alice's body was discovered.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: To clarify the timeline, can anyone confirm seeing Alice after she left Medbay, and what were their locations before and after the discovery of her body?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The evidence is clear - Erin left Upper Engine moments before I found Alice's body, and their vague responses about their timeline only make them more suspicious compared to Bob's detailed account.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Let's prioritize confirming Alice's movements after leaving Medbay;  precise timelines from everyone regarding their location before and after the discovery are crucial for eliminating inconsistencies.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with focusing on Alice's movements after Medbay, and while I can't give an exact time for my presence near Upper Engine, I maintain I didn't see her body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's create a shared timeline:  who saw Alice after Medbay, and where was everyone between then and the discovery of the body in the Upper Engine?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The fact that Erin keeps agreeing to establish timelines but still won't provide specific details about their movements near Upper Engine, while everyone else has been transparent, makes them extremely suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Let's focus on creating a shared timeline of everyone's location before and after Alice's death, starting with who saw her after she left Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: To help create that timeline, I recall seeing Alice in Medbay earlier, but after that, my focus shifted to completing tasks, so I can't offer precise details about her movements or my own.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion:
