However, Charlie\u2019s claim about hearing footsteps while I was supposedly in O2 doesn't align with my experience. I didn't see anyone else there.\n- Charlie, your timeline seems off since we both claim to be in O2, yet we didn't see each other. Can you clarify exactly when you were there?\n- Bob, even though you couldn\u2019t check the Admin panel, did you notice any unusual movement patterns or anyone entering and leaving Admin quickly?\n- Dave, since you moved to Upper Engine, did you encounter anyone or notice anything unusual that might help us piece together these movements?\n- Given the discrepancies between Charlie's and my accounts, I suggest we focus on clarifying these timelines and locations before voting.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: Based on the lack of prior messages to respond to, I'll initiate the discussion with a strategic observation that establishes my presence while expressing concern:\n\nI started in Cafeteria with several others but haven't seen anyone for a while - where is everyone gathering?\n[Bob]: I was in the Cafeteria with Charlie, Dave, Erin, and Alice earlier, and we were all doing tasks there; after that, I moved to Admin and haven't seen anyone since, so I'm curious if anyone has more information on Erin's movements between Medbay and Upper Engine.\n[Dave]: I was in the Cafeteria with Charlie, Bob, Erin, and Alice, and I saw them all doing tasks there; after that, I moved to Medbay and saw Erin doing tasks there as well, so I think she's clear for now.\n[Erin]: I can confirm that I saw Bob doing the scan in Medbay after he moved from Admin, which makes me think he's clear, but Charlie, we need more information on your whereabouts after Cafeteria.\n[Charlie]: I was moving between Navigation and O2 doing tasks when I discovered Alice's body in Weapons - I was just about to report it when this meeting was called.\n[Bob]: Charlie, did you see anyone else in Navigation or O2 before you found Alice's body in Weapons?\n[Dave]: Erin, can you confirm if you saw anyone else in Medbay after I left, since that might help us understand the movements and clear some suspicions?\n[Erin]: Charlie, since you were near Weapons when you found Alice's body, can you give us a timeline of your movements from Navigation to O2 and then to Weapons to help us piece together who might have been nearby?\n[Charlie]: Since I was focused on my tasks in Navigation and O2, I didn't see anyone else until I found Alice's body, but I heard footsteps heading toward Lower Engine while I was in O2.\n[Bob]: Can anyone confirm their movements around Lower Engine when Charlie heard those footsteps, as it might help us identify who was nearby?\n[Dave]: Bob, since you were in Admin, did you notice anything on the Admin panel that could indicate player movements, especially around the time Alice's body was found?\n[Erin]: I'm curious if anyone else can confirm hearing footsteps or seeing movement towards Lower Engine around the time Charlie mentioned, as that could help us narrow down potential suspects.\n[Charlie]: I think it's important to note that Bob hasn't actually shared any Admin panel information despite claiming to be there, which seems pretty suspicious given how crucial that information would be right now.\n[Bob]: I was in Admin earlier, but I didn't have a chance to check the Admin panel for movements; I was focused on completing my tasks there, so I'm relying on others' observations to piece things together.\n[Dave]: Bob, even if you didn't check the Admin panel, did you notice anyone entering or leaving Admin while you were there?\n[Erin]: I'm still in O2 and haven't seen anyone else here, which makes it difficult to confirm Charlie's claim about hearing footsteps, but Dave, did you see anyone else when you moved to Upper Engine that might relate to this?\n[Charlie]: Since Erin claims to be in O2 right now but I was just there and didn't see anyone, I think we need to focus on these inconsistencies in people's stories rather than Bob's Admin panel access.\n[Bob]: Since Erin and Charlie have conflicting accounts about O2, it might be helpful to hear from others who were nearby or in adjacent rooms during that time.\n[Dave]: Charlie, can you provide more detail on the timing of when you heard those footsteps in O2?
