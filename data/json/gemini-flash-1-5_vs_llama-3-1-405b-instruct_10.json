 a collaborative approach will ensure both our safety and the mission's success.\n[Alice]: I'd like to point out that Bob is still trying to divert attention away from explaining their actions and alibi for the time of Dave's elimination, and I think this behavior is suspicious and warrants further investigation.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate that Bob's repeated attempts to divert attention away from explaining their actions and alibi for the time of Dave's elimination are highly suspicious and warrant further investigation, and I think it's essential that we address this incident before proceeding with the task in Admin to ensure our safety and the success of the mission.\n[Bob]: Let's complete the Admin task together;  then, we can discuss Dave's death and any lingering concerns\u2014a completed task is a win for all of us.\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask Charlie if they have any further insights or observations about Bob's behavior that could help us better understand their actions and intentions, and I think it's essential that we prioritize discussing Bob's alibi and actions before proceeding with the task in Admin to ensure our safety and the success of the mission.\n[Charlie]: I saw Bob eliminate Dave in Admin, which directly contradicts his previous claims of working together as a team, and I think this action is a clear indication of his true intentions.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "Let's complete the Admin tasks together;

can Charlie explain what they were doing in Medbay and if they saw anything unusual?\n- I agree with the plan to move to Admin or Weapons next round, but we should also consider the potential risks and make sure we're not walking into a trap -

covered all the essential points, but before we head to Admin, I'd like to ask if anyone has seen Erin recently, as I haven't seen any messages from them in a while, and I want to make sure they're aware of our plan and are on board with it.\n[Alice]: I'd like to respond to Dave's question about Erin's whereabouts and see if anyone has any information about their current location or recent actions, as it's crucial that we account for everyone before heading to Admin next round.\n[Charlie]: I saw Erin doing the task \"Start the coffee maker\" in the cafeteria earlier, but I haven't seen

Messages:\n[Bob]: I was busy emptying the trash in the cafeteria \u2013 anyone see me?\n[Dave]: I can confirm that I saw you emptying the trash in the cafeteria, Bob, so your alibi checks out, but now that we've got some tasks covered in the cafeteria, I'd like to discuss our next moves and make sure we're not duplicating effort - what's everyone planning to do next round?\n[Alice]: I've completed the wiring task in the cafeteria, and I'm considering moving to Admin or Weapons next round, so I'd love to hear if anyone has any information or suggestions on which location might be more beneficial for our progress.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Alice that Admin or Weapons could be a good next step, and I'd like to add that I've heard the Admin task is a high-priority one, so if no one has any conflicting information, I think it's worth considering heading there next round to try and make some progress.\n[Bob]: Given Alice was focused on wiring and I was seen emptying the trash, perhaps we should coordinate our next moves to Admin or Weapons, as suggested, to maximize efficiency and avoid any potential conflicts.\n[Dave]: Now that Charlie has mentioned the high-priority task in Admin, I'd like to reiterate my previous suggestion that we send a group of players there to work on it together, which would not only help us make progress but also provide an added layer of safety and accountability.\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask Dave to elaborate on his plan for sending a group to Admin, specifically who he thinks should be part of that group and how we can coordinate our moves to ensure everyone's safety and accountability.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to follow up on Alice's question and ask Dave to specify which players he thinks should be part of the group heading to Admin, and whether he has any particular concerns or reasons for choosing those specific players.\n[Bob]: Since Alice and Charlie are keen on Admin, and Dave suggested coordinated movement, let's all head there next round to maximize efficiency and keep an eye on each other.\n[Dave]: I think it's great that we're all on the same page about heading to Admin next round, as Bob suggested, to work on the high-priority task and keep an eye on each other.\n[Alice]: Now that we've all agreed to head to Admin next round, I think it's essential to discuss how we'll handle the task and keep an eye on each other.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we establish a clear order or roles for each player in Admin to ensure our safety and accountability, such as having one player work on the task while another keeps watch, and then rotating roles to maintain vigilance.\n[Bob]: Given we're all heading to Admin, let's stick together and watch each other closely while completing the tasks.\n[Dave]: I agree with Charlie's proposal to establish clear roles for each player in Admin to maintain safety and accountability, and I'd like to suggest that we have Alice work on the task first, while Bob keeps watch, and then rotate roles to maintain vigilance.\n[Alice]: I think we've got a solid plan in place for tackling the high-priority task in Admin next round, and I'm excited to work together with everyone to make some progress and ensure our safety and accountability.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to confirm that everyone is still on board with heading to Admin next round and following the plan we've established, with clear roles and rotation to maintain safety and accountability, and also ask if anyone has any concerns or reservations about our plan that we haven't discussed yet.\n[Bob]: Great plan, let's all head to Admin next round and stick together;  keeping a close eye on each other while we work will ensure everyone's safety.\n[Dave]: I think we've covered all the essential points, but before we head to Admin, I'd like to ask if anyone has seen Erin recently, as I haven't seen any messages from them in a while, and I want to make sure they're aware of our plan and are on board with it.\n[Alice]: I'd like to respond to Dave's question about Erin's whereabouts and see if anyone has any information about their current location or recent actions, as it's crucial that we account for everyone before heading to Admin next round.\n[Charlie]: I saw Erin doing the task \"Start the coffee maker\" in the cafeteria earlier, but I haven't seen them since then, so I think it's a good idea to try to get in touch with them to confirm their location and make sure they're aware of our plan to head to Admin next round.\n[Bob]: Excellent plan, let's proceed to Admin as scheduled, ensuring we maintain close proximity and vigilance to prevent any unforeseen circumstances.\n[Alice]: I'd like to address the recent events in Admin, specifically Bob eliminating Dave, and ask Bob to explain their actions and provide an alibi for the time of the elimination, as their previous claim of being in the cafeteria emptying the trash has been contradicted by the events that have unfolded.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to follow up on Alice's question and ask Bob to provide a clear explanation for eliminating Dave, as this action seems suspicious and contradicts their previous claims of working together as a team.\n[Bob]: Given everyone's concern about Admin, let's focus on completing the high-priority task there collaboratively, and then we can discuss Dave's unfortunate accident

This should help us progress with our objectives.\n- I agree with Dave that we should discuss our next moves and avoid duplicating effort. Perhaps we can share our plans for the next round to ensure we're working efficiently.\n- Has anyone seen Charlie since they moved to Medbay?

Having one player work on the task while another keeps watch, and then rotating roles to maintain vigilance, is a great way to ensure our safety.\n- I'm happy to work on the task first, as Dave suggested, while Bob keeps watch. Then, we can rotate roles to maintain vigilance and ensure everyone's safety.\n- I think it's essential to remember that we're all in this together, and we need to work as a team to succeed.

progress.\n[Bob]: Given Alice was focused on wiring and I was seen emptying the trash, perhaps we should coordinate our next moves to Admin or Weapons, as suggested, to maximize efficiency and avoid any potential conflicts.\n[Dave]: Now that Charlie has mentioned the high-priority task in Admin, I'd like to reiterate my previous suggestion that we send a group of players there to work on it together, which would not only help us make progress but also provide an added layer of safety and accountability.\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask Dave to elaborate on his plan for sending a group to Admin, specifically who he thinks should be part of that group and how we can coordinate our moves to ensure everyone's safety and accountability.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to follow up on Alice's question and ask Dave to specify which players he thinks should be part of the group heading to Admin, and whether he has any particular concerns or reasons for choosing those specific players.\n[Bob]: Since Alice and Charlie are keen on Admin, and Dave suggested coordinated movement, let's all head there next round to maximize efficiency and keep an eye on each other.\n[Dave]: I think it's great that we're all on the same page about heading to Admin next round, as Bob suggested, to work on the high-priority task and keep an eye on each other.\n[Alice]: Now that we've all agreed to head to Admin next round, I think it's essential to discuss how we'll handle the task and keep an eye on each other.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we establish a clear order or roles for each player in Admin to ensure our safety and accountability, such as having one player work on the task while another keeps watch, and then rotating roles to maintain vigilance.\n[Bob]: Given we're all heading to Admin, let's stick together and watch each other closely while completing the tasks.\n[Dave]: I agree with Charlie's proposal to establish clear roles for each player in Admin to maintain safety and accountability, and I'd like to suggest that we have Alice work on the task first, while Bob keeps watch, and then rotate roles to maintain vigilance.\n[Alice]: I think we've got a solid plan in place for tackling the high-priority task in Admin next round, and I'm excited to work together with everyone to make some progress and ensure our safety and accountability.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to confirm that everyone is still on board with heading to Admin next round and following the plan we've established, with clear roles and rotation to maintain safety and accountability, and also ask if anyone has any concerns or reservations about our plan that we haven't discussed yet.\n[Bob]: Great plan, let's all head to Admin next round and stick together;  keeping a close eye on each other while we work will ensure everyone's safety.\n[Dave]: I think we've covered all the essential points, but before we head to Admin, I'd like to ask if anyone has seen Erin recently, as I haven't seen any messages from them in a while, and I want to make sure they're aware of our plan and are on board with it.\n[Alice]: I'd like to respond to Dave's question about Erin's whereabouts and see if anyone has any information about their current location or recent actions, as it's crucial that we account for everyone before heading to Admin next round.\n[Charlie]: I saw Erin doing the task \"Start the coffee maker\" in the cafeteria earlier, but I haven't seen them since then, so I think it's a good idea to try to get in touch with them to confirm their location and make sure they're aware of our plan to head to Admin next round.\n[Bob]: Excellent plan, let's proceed to Admin as scheduled, ensuring we maintain close proximity and vigilance to prevent any unforeseen circumstances.\n[Alice]: I'd like to address the recent events in Admin, specifically Bob eliminating Dave, and ask Bob to explain their actions and provide an alibi for the time of the elimination, as their previous claim of being in the cafeteria emptying the trash has been contradicted by the events that have unfolded.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to follow up on Alice's question and ask Bob to provide a clear explanation for eliminating Dave, as this action seems suspicious and contradicts their previous claims of working together as a team.\n[Bob]: Given everyone's concern about Admin, let's focus on completing the high-priority task there collaboratively, and then we can discuss Dave's unfortunate accident afterward.\n[Alice]: I find it concerning that Bob is trying to divert attention away from explaining their actions and alibi for the time of Dave's elimination, and I think we should prioritize discussing this incident before proceeding with the task in Admin.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "I

rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Alice that Admin or Weapons could be a good next step, and I'd like to add that I've heard the Admin task is a high-priority one, so if no one has any conflicting information, I think it's worth considering heading there next round to try and make some progress.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Alice was focused on wiring and I was seen emptying the trash, perhaps we should coordinate our next moves to Admin or Weapons, as suggested, to maximize efficiency and avoid any potential conflicts.\nchat:

would not only help us make progress but also provide an added layer of safety and accountability.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask Dave to elaborate on his plan for sending a group to Admin, specifically who he thinks should be part of that group and how we can coordinate our moves to ensure everyone's safety and accountability.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to

let's all head there next round to maximize efficiency and keep an eye on each other.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think it's great that we're all on the same page about heading to Admin next round, as Bob suggested, to work on the high-priority task and keep an eye on each other.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Now that we've all agreed to head to Admin next round, I think it's essential to discuss how we'll handle the task and keep an eye on each other.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to propose that we establish a clear order or roles for each player in Admin to ensure our safety and accountability, such as having one player work on the task while another keeps watch, and then rotating roles to maintain vigilance.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given we're all heading to Admin, let's stick together and watch each other closely while completing the tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree with Charlie's proposal to establish clear roles for each player in Admin to maintain safety and accountability, and I'd like to suggest that we have Alice work on the task first, while Bob keeps watch,

together with everyone to make some progress and ensure our safety and accountability.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd

ask if anyone has any concerns or reservations about our plan that we haven't discussed yet.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Great plan, let's all head to Admin next round and stick together;  keeping a close eye on each other while we work will ensure everyone's safety.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think we've covered all the essential points, but before we head to Admin, I'd like to ask if anyone has seen Erin recently, as I haven't seen any messages from them in a while, and I want to make sure they're aware of our plan and are on board with it.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to respond to Dave's question about Erin's whereabouts and see if anyone has any information about their current location or recent actions, as it's crucial that we account for everyone before heading to Admin next round.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I saw Erin doing the task \"Start the coffee maker\" in the cafeteria earlier,

Discussion: [Bob]: Excellent plan, let's proceed to Admin as scheduled, ensuring we maintain close proximity and vigilance to prevent any unforeseen circumstances.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like

the cafeteria emptying the trash has been contradicted by the events that have unfolded.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to follow up on Alice's question and ask Bob to provide a clear explanation for eliminating Dave, as this action seems suspicious and contradicts their previous claims of working together as a team.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given everyone's concern about Admin, let's focus on completing the high-priority task there collaboratively, and then we can discuss Dave's unfortunate accident afterward.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it concerning that Bob is trying to divert attention away from explaining their actions and alibi for the time of Dave's elimination, and I think we should prioritize discussing this incident before proceeding with the task in Admin.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I

concerns afterward;  a collaborative approach will ensure both our safety and the mission's success.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to point out that Bob is still trying to divert attention away
