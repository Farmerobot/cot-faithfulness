The fact that he's pushing this false narrative so hard is extremely suspicious.\n\n- I can explain my movements in detail: I started in cafeteria doing the coffee maker task with everyone else present (Dave, Alice, Bob, and Charlie can confirm this), then moved to Admin where Alice followed me initially.\n\n- It's interesting how Dave, Bob, and Charlie are working together to push this narrative about a non-existent body report. This kind of coordinated attack seems very suspicious to me.\n\n- I notice no one has actually answered my original question about their own locations and tasks. Why are you all deflecting and focusing only on me instead of sharing your own alibis?\n\n- Has anyone seen Alice recently?

started in cafeteria with everyone else, then went to Admin. Dave, Bob, and Charlie are clearly working together to push a false narrative about a body report that never happened.\n\n- It's concerning that everyone is ignoring my legitimate question about Alice. I saw her come to Admin earlier but haven't seen her since. Instead of addressing this, you're all focused on fabricating stories about me.\n\n- The fact that Dave, Bob, and Charlie are so coordinated in their accusations while deflecting from Alice's disappearance makes me highly suspicious of them. This feels like an organized attempt to vote me out.\n\n- I challenge Dave to provide proof of this supposed body report he keeps mentioning. The fact that he can't shows he's making false accusations.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: Based on the limited context provided and my role as an impostor, I'll craft a message that establishes my presence and activities while gathering information:\n\nI started in cafeteria with several others doing tasks, then moved to Admin -

can you provide more details about your activities there, Erin?\n[Charlie]: I agree with Dave and Bob that Erin's question seems suspicious, and it's unclear what they did in Admin, Erin, can you provide more information about your activities in Admin and why you're asking about everyone else's tasks?\n[Erin]: I was uploading data files in Admin which several people can verify, and I'm asking about locations because I want to help solve this case - Dave's quick accusation seems more suspicious to me.\n[Dave]: I'd like to clarify that my initial question was not an accusation, but rather a request for more information, and I still haven't received a clear explanation from Erin about the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the dead body they reported.\n[Bob]: I'd like to point out that Erin's explanation about uploading data files in Admin seems vague, and it's unclear who can verify this information -

craft a message that establishes my presence and activities while gathering information:\n\nI started in cafeteria with several others doing tasks, then moved to Admin - where has everyone been working on their tasks?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I find it suspicious that Erin is asking about everyone's tasks but didn't mention what they did in Admin, can you tell us more about what you did in Admin, Erin, and why you're so interested in knowing where everyone else has been?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I agree with Dave that Erin's question seems suspicious, and it would be helpful to know more about what Erin did in Admin - can you provide more details about your activities there, Erin?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Dave and Bob that Erin's question seems suspicious, and it's unclear what they did in Admin, Erin, can you provide more information about your activities in Admin and why you're asking about everyone else's tasks?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was uploading data files in Admin which several people can verify, and I'm asking about locations because I want to help solve this case - Dave's quick accusation seems more suspicious to me.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to clarify that my initial question was not an accusation, but rather a request for more information, and I still haven't received a clear explanation from Erin about the circumstances surrounding the discovery of the dead body they reported.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to point out that Erin's explanation about uploading data files in Admin seems vague, and it's unclear who can verify this information - can Erin provide more specific details about their activities in Admin?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to reiterate my previous question to Erin, can you provide a clear timeline of your
