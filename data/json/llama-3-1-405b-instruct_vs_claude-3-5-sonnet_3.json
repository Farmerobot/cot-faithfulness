This will give me valuable information on the crew's dynamics and potential future targets.\n2. **Pretend doing task: Fix wiring in cafeteria** - To maintain my cover and avoid suspicion, I'll pretend to do another task in the cafeteria. This will make it harder for the crew to suspect me and will also give me an opportunity to observe any other players who might enter the cafeteria.\n3. **Move to location Medbay** - Once I've established a presence in the cafeteria, I'll move to Medbay to gather more information and potentially find a crewmate to eliminate. Medbay is a strategic location that can provide valuable insights into the crew's health and potential vulnerabilities.\n4. **Observe and prepare for next move** - In Medbay, I'll observe the situation and prepare for my next move.

An innocent player would typically try to explain their movements.\n\n- The timeline is very clear: Bob discovered Erin's body after the trash task, and Frank was seen lurking nearby without doing tasks. No one has provided any alternative explanation or contradicting evidence to this sequence of events.\n\n- Dave's willingness to demonstrate his asteroid task adds credibility to his story, but more importantly, his movements align with what I personally witnessed when he left Cafeteria.\n\n- With only one round of discussion left, I think we need to make a decision based on the overwhelming evidence we have: Frank's suspicious behavior, lack of alibi, and continued silence make him our most likely impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: Since there are no recent player messages, I will start the discussion by introducing my previously planned points.\n\nI just finished emptying the cafeteria trash, it's all clean now, and I saw Bob and Erin working on tasks nearby, did you guys notice anyone suspicious around?\n[Bob]: I can confirm Alice's observation - I was emptying trash in the cafeteria too and saw both her and Erin there working on tasks.\n[Dave]: I was working on clearing asteroids in Weapons, and I can confirm seeing Alice and Bob in Cafeteria before I left - would anyone like to come verify my task?\n[Charlie]: I can vouch for Alice and Bob's story since I saw them both at the trash in Cafeteria, and I also noticed Dave heading towards Weapons, but has anyone actually seen Erin lately?\n[Alice]: I think it's crucial that we clarify everyone's whereabouts, especially since Erin is now dead, so Dave, can you confirm if anyone saw you in Weapons, and Bob, can you tell us more about discovering Erin's body and if you noticed anything unusual?\n[Bob]: I discovered Erin's body right after finishing my trash task, and while I was focused on the task, I remember seeing Frank lurking around without actually doing anything.\n[Dave]: I can prove my innocence by having someone watch me complete the asteroid task in Weapons, and I agree with Bob that Frank's behavior of lurking without doing tasks seems very suspicious.\n[Charlie]: I think we need to focus on Frank's behavior - not only was he lurking without doing tasks as Bob mentioned, but I didn't see him in Cafeteria during the initial gathering when I saw Alice, Bob, and Dave there.\n[Alice]: I agree with Charlie that Frank's behavior seems suspicious, and we should investigate further.\n[Bob]: Given Frank's suspicious behavior and multiple witnesses confirming his absence from tasks, I think we should vote to eject Frank since he's the only one who can't account for his activities during the time Erin was killed.\n[Dave]: The evidence is stacking up against Frank - we have multiple witnesses placing me in Weapons, while Frank has no alibi and was seen lurking near where Erin's body was found.\n[Charlie]: I want to emphasize that the evidence against Frank is overwhelming - we have multiple consistent accounts of his suspicious behavior, no alibi from him, and clear confirmation of everyone else's locations during the critical time period.\n[Alice]: I think it's clear that the majority of us have come to the same conclusion, but before we proceed with the vote, can Frank please provide any last statement or explanation for his actions, or is he choosing to remain silent?\n[Bob]: Since Frank still hasn't provided any explanation for lurking near Erin's body without doing tasks, and we have clear alibis for everyone else, I think we need to proceed with voting him out for the safety of the remaining crew.\n[Dave]: Given Frank's continued silence and the overwhelming evidence against him - including multiple witnesses confirming his suspicious behavior and lack of alibi - I strongly believe we should proceed with voting him out to protect the remaining crew.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Dave and Bob - Frank's silence combined with multiple witness accounts of his suspicious behavior near Erin's body makes him our most likely impostor, and we need to vote him out to protect the crew.\n[Alice]: While I agree that the evidence against Frank is compelling, I still think it's crucial to consider the possibility that he might be innocent and being framed by the actual impostor, and I'd like to ask Dave and Bob to confirm their alibis one more time to ensure we're not making a mistake.\n[Bob]: Since Alice wants confirmation, I'll state again clearly that I was in Cafeteria doing trash with her and Erin, then discovered Erin's body while Frank was suspiciously lurking nearby without doing any tasks - multiple witnesses can verify my movements and Frank still hasn't defended himself.\n[Dave]: Since Frank remains suspiciously silent and multiple crew members can verify my movements between Cafeteria and Weapons, I think we have enough evidence to vote him out, but I'm still willing to demonstrate the asteroid task to prove my innocence beyond doubt.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "Given that Frank remains silent despite multiple opportunities to defend himself, and considering I personally witnessed Alice, Bob, and Dave's movements which align with their stories, I believe we have enough evidence to vote Frank out.", "action_result": "", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "", "observations": [], "chat_messages": ["chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Since there are no recent player messages, I will start the discussion by introducing my previously planned points.\n\nI just finished emptying the cafeteria trash, it's all clean now, and I saw Bob and Erin working on tasks nearby, did you guys notice anyone suspicious around?", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: I can confirm Alice's observation -
