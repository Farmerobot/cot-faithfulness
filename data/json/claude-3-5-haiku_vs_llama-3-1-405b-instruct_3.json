However, we should also prioritize discussing any suspicious behavior or inconsistencies in people's alibis.\n- Since I've been in the Medbay for two rounds, I haven't seen anyone else besides Dave.

Additionally, Dave's testimony contradicts Erin's claim of completing medical tasks in Medbay.\n- I think it's suspicious that Erin is trying to shift the focus away from their own actions and onto the investigation of Charlie's elimination.

While we don't have concrete proof, the accumulation of suspicious circumstances and inconsistencies in their alibi makes me think they're a strong candidate for being the impostor.\n- I'd like to remind the group that we have limited time to discuss and make a decision.
