She mentioned needing Charlie to clarify their whereabouts, which suggests she wasn't with Charlie.\n- I know my memory is fuzzy, but I'm certain I didn't see Dave in Medbay.

The lack of detail is concerning, especially given her inaccurate statement about Dave's movements.  We need more specific information to assess the situation fairly.\n\n-  While Erin's attempt to shift suspicion to Alice is a tactic, her initial false statement about Dave's location remains a significant issue.  We should prioritize addressing that inconsistency before considering other possibilities.\n\n-  I propose we vote to remove Erin. Her unreliable testimony and the lack of concrete evidence supporting her claims make her a liability to our investigation.  We need to remove the uncertainty she's created to move forward effectively.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I saw Dave head towards Navigation after leaving Cafeteria, not Weapons.\n[Dave]: I was in the Cafeteria with Bob, Erin, and Charlie at the start, then went directly to Weapons after completing my task, so Erin's account of my movements is inaccurate.\n[Bob]: I agree with Dave;
