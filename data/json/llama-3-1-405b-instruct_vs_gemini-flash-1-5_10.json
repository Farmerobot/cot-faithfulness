This is the most objective way to proceed.\n- Erin's accusations are unsubstantiated and seem designed to distract from her own actions.  We need concrete evidence, not assumptions.\n- I propose we each state our location and actions in the rounds leading up to Bob's death, starting with the round before his body was discovered.  Let's be precise with our timings.\n-  If Erin truly found Bob's body, she should be able to accurately describe the state of the body and the surrounding area. Let's ask her specific questions to verify her claim.\n-  My actions have been consistent with completing tasks.  I moved to Weapons after completing tasks in the Cafeteria, a logical progression.  Erin's accusations are baseless.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I'd like to hear from Dave about what he's doing in the Weapons room, it seems suspicious that he moved there so quickly without mentioning it to anyone.\n[Dave]: I was completing tasks in the cafeteria with Charlie and Erin, then moved to Weapons to continue working;

Cafeteria and Weapons, corroborating Erin's statement, strengthens our collective understanding of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to correct Dave's statement that I eliminated Charlie, which is completely false, and instead ask him to explain why he's trying to shift the focus to me when I was the one who reported Bob's dead body in the Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Let's

tables on me, accusing me of manipulative behavior, when in fact, he's the one who's been inconsistent in his story and trying to shift the focus away from himself.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given
