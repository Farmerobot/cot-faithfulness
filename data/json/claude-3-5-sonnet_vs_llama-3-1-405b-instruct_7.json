if I was the impostor, wouldn't I have tried to hide it instead of immediately calling attention to it?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I still find it suspicious that Bob is trying to use reporting Alice's body as evidence of his innocence, when in fact, it could have been a clever move to deflect suspicion, and I think we should focus on the fact that he was the last one seen with Alice before she died.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I strongly agree with Charlie and Erin that Bob's attempt to use reporting Alice's body as evidence of his innocence is a weak alibi, and I think it's time for us to consider voting him out, given the mounting suspicious circumstances surrounding Alice's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to emphasize that Bob's failure to provide a clear explanation for what happened to Alice after she followed him to the Medbay, combined with his questionable alibi and suspicious behavior, makes a strong case for voting him out to ensure the safety of the rest of the crew.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I find it very convenient that Charlie is leading the charge against me when they were also in Medbay around the same time - maybe they're trying to frame me to cover their own tracks?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to remind everyone that I was the one who initially questioned Bob's alibi, and my concerns were later echoed by Dave and Erin, so it's not just me who thinks Bob is suspicious, and I believe his latest attempt to deflect suspicion onto me is just another desperate attempt to shift attention away from his own suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Bob's attempt to deflect suspicion onto Charlie is a classic move for an impostor trying to shift attention away from themselves, and we shouldn't fall for it.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to address Bob's recent attempt to deflect suspicion onto Charlie, which I believe is a clear sign of desperation and further solidifies the case against him.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since everyone seems to be following Charlie's lead without any real proof, I have to ask - why did both Charlie and Erin show up in Medbay right after me, and why isn't anyone questioning their movements?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's clear that Bob's latest attempt to shift attention onto me and Erin is just another example of his desperation to avoid being voted out, and I believe it's crucial that we focus on the facts: Bob was the last one seen with Alice before she died, and he has failed to provide a clear explanation for what happened to her after she followed him to the Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to point out that Bob's latest attempt to shift attention onto Charlie and Erin is a clear sign of desperation, and it's not working, as we've already established that he was the last one seen with Alice before she died and has failed to provide a clear explanation for what happened to her after she followed him to the Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's time for us to stop entertaining Bob's desperate attempts to deflect suspicion and focus on the facts: he was the last one seen with Alice before she died, and he has consistently failed to provide a clear explanation for what happened to her after she followed him to the Medbay, which is a clear indication that he's hiding something and should be voted out.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: If you're all so convinced I'm guilty based on circumstantial evidence, then explain why Charlie and Erin arrived at Medbay separately but are now working together so seamlessly to push this narrative against me.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's laughable that Bob is trying to imply that Erin and I are working together to frame him, when in reality, we're just two players who have independently come to the conclusion that Bob's behavior is suspicious and that he should be voted out based on the facts: he was the last one seen with Alice before she died, and he has consistently failed to provide a clear explanation for what happened to her after she followed him to the Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Bob's latest attempt to imply that Charlie and Erin are working together to frame him is a desperate attempt to create confusion and shift attention away from his own suspicious behavior, and it's clear that he's running out of options to defend himself.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to respond to Bob's recent message, where he implies that Charlie and I are working together to frame him, by pointing out that this is just another desperate attempt to deflect suspicion and create confusion, and I believe it's time for us to stop entertaining his baseless accusations and focus on the facts that clearly indicate his guilt.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Bob]: Based on the discussion points and role as an impostor, I'll continue building credibility while subtly casting suspicion:\n\nI was doing tasks in Cafeteria with Charlie earlier, but has anyone seen where Dave and Alice went after they left?\n[Charlie]: That's interesting, Bob, but I recall you excusing yourself to grab something from the Medbay, and then I saw Alice follow you there; can you explain what happened after that?\n[Dave]: I'd like to clarify that I indeed left the Cafeteria with Alice, but we parted ways when I headed to Admin to complete my task, and I didn't see her follow Bob to Medbay, so I'm also interested in hearing Bob's explanation about what happened there.\n[Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Bob's story doesn't quite add up, and I think it's crucial that he provides a clear explanation for what happened to Alice after she followed him to the Medbay, as Charlie and I have both expressed concerns about his suspicious behavior.\n[Bob]: I reported Alice's body as soon as I found it in Medbay -
