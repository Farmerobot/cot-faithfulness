not trying to deceive anyone.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to add to Dave's concerns by suggesting that we also review the security footage from Medbay to see if it shows any unusual patterns

reported Charlie's body in such a high-risk location like Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate that my report of Charlie's body was based on my genuine concern for the safety of our crew, and I'm happy to cooperate with any investigation into my actions and movements in Medbay, but I think it's essential to focus on concrete evidence and not let speculation and accusations cloud our judgment.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's crucial that we prioritize reviewing the security footage from Medbay, as suggested, and also consider Bob's proposal to focus on concrete

Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to ask Dave to clarify what specific actions he's observed that make him think Charlie and I are working together, as I'm confident that my intentions are genuine and I'm
