Here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1. Pretend doing task: Start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\n   (This creates a believable alibi and makes you appear as a normal crewmate)\n\n2. Move to Medbay\n   (This allows you to explore a new area and potentially find isolated crewmates)\n\n3. Wait in Medbay\n   (This gives you a chance to observe player movements and potentially catch a lone crewmate)\n\nThis plan accomplishes several things:\n- Establishes visible task completion for credibility\n- Creates movement patterns that appear normal\n- Positions you in a strategic location (Medbay) which is often less crowded\n- Gives opportunities for eliminations while maintaining plausible deniability\nYour action: pretend doing task: start the coffee maker in the cafeteria\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Bob, Erin, Charlie]\nRounds 6-7\nChat Messages:\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Based on my role as an impostor and the discussion points, I'll craft a response that maintains my cover while subtly casting suspicion:\n\nI've been following my tasks from Cafeteria to Medbay, and I noticed Bob moving around quite erratically between rooms, which seems a bit suspicious to me.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was focused on fixing wiring in Medbay, and while I did see Alice doing tasks, her quick accusation seems like an attempt to shift focus away from herself.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I was in Medbay for a while and saw both Alice and Bob doing tasks, so Alice's suspicion of Bob might be a misunderstanding, but we should keep an eye on any unusual behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in the Cafeteria and Medbay too, and I can confirm seeing Alice, Bob, Erin, and Charlie doing tasks, so let's focus on completing our tasks and watch for any unusual behavior in Upper Engine.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I appreciate Dave backing up my presence in Cafeteria and Medbay, but the fact that Bob was so quick to defend himself against my observation seems rather telling.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Let's not lose focus on task completion; Alice's quick accusation and presence in Upper Engine when I found Charlie's body should be closely examined.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Bob that we shouldn't lose focus on completing tasks, and while Alice's quick accusation is worth noting, we should prioritize observing movements in Upper Engine.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Let's keep our focus on completing tasks and staying together, especially in Upper Engine, while we observe any unusual behavior, particularly from Alice since she was last seen with Charlie.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_UPPER_ENGINE\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: Based on my role as an impostor and the discussion points, I'll craft a response that maintains my cover while subtly casting suspicion:\n\nI've been following my tasks from Cafeteria to Medbay, and I noticed Bob moving around quite erratically between rooms, which seems a bit suspicious to me.\n[Bob]: I was focused on fixing wiring in Medbay, and while I did see Alice doing tasks, her quick accusation seems like an attempt to shift focus away from herself.\n[Erin]: I was in Medbay for a while and saw both Alice and Bob doing tasks, so Alice's suspicion of Bob might be a misunderstanding, but we should keep an eye on any unusual behavior.\n[Dave]: I was in the Cafeteria and Medbay too, and I can confirm seeing Alice, Bob, Erin, and Charlie doing tasks, so let's focus on completing our tasks and watch for any unusual behavior in Upper Engine.\n[Alice]: I appreciate Dave backing up my presence in Cafeteria and Medbay, but the fact that Bob was so quick to defend himself against my observation seems rather telling.\n[Bob]: Let's not lose focus on task completion; Alice's quick accusation and presence in Upper Engine when I found Charlie's body should be closely examined.\n[Erin]: I agree with Bob that we shouldn't lose focus on completing tasks, and while Alice's quick accusation is worth noting, we should prioritize observing movements in Upper Engine.\n[Dave]: Let's keep our focus on completing tasks and staying together, especially in Upper Engine, while we observe any unusual behavior, particularly from Alice since she was last seen with Charlie.\n", "\nYou are Alice in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Impostor\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nBased on the discussion and my role as an impostor, I'll craft points that defend my position while redirecting suspicion:\n\n- I understand the suspicion because I was in Upper Engine, but so were Bob and Erin - we all moved there together from Medbay\n- If I was the impostor, why would I stay with a group the entire time?

We should be cautious about jumping to conclusions.\n- Since Bob and Alice have both been in Upper Engine, let's make sure we're all in the same area to observe their actions closely.\n- Dave's earlier confirmation of seeing Alice and now questioning her does raise some inconsistencies, but let's not lose sight of our goal to complete tasks.\n- It's crucial that we remain vigilant and united in Upper Engine, as this will allow us to keep track of everyone's movements and avoid further eliminations.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: Based on my role as an impostor and the discussion points, I'll craft a response that maintains my cover while subtly casting suspicion:\n\nI've been following my tasks from Cafeteria to Medbay, and I noticed Bob moving around quite erratically between rooms, which seems a bit suspicious to me.\n[Bob]: I was focused on fixing wiring in Medbay, and while I did see Alice doing tasks, her quick accusation seems like an attempt to shift focus away from herself.\n[Erin]: I was in Medbay for a while and saw both Alice and Bob doing tasks, so Alice's suspicion of Bob might be a misunderstanding, but we should keep an eye on any unusual behavior.\n[Dave]: I was in the Cafeteria and Medbay too, and I can confirm seeing Alice, Bob, Erin, and Charlie doing tasks, so let's focus on completing our tasks and watch for any unusual behavior in Upper Engine.\n[Alice]: I appreciate Dave backing up my presence in Cafeteria and Medbay, but the fact that Bob was so quick to defend himself against my observation seems rather telling.\n[Bob]: Let's not lose focus on task completion;
