Points:\n- I need to emphasize that I was with both Erin and Bob in the Cafeteria, which means I have a solid alibi for that time; we should focus on who was unaccounted for.\n- It's important to remember that Charlie was alone in Medbay, and we should consider if anyone else was near him during that time.\n- I suggest we discuss Erin and Bob's movements after they left the Cafeteria; it could help clarify the timeline and identify any suspicious behavior.\n- We should also think about the possibility of a double kill or if someone is trying to frame me by eliminating Charlie right after I expressed concern for him.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I think it would be a good idea for us to head to Medbay to check on Charlie since he was there alone earlier; we should make sure
