Let's start with Erin, since she was in the Cafeteria.\n-  It's important to remember that corroborating each other's accounts is key to finding the imposter.  If we can create a solid timeline, any inconsistencies will be more obvious.\n-  Let's also consider task completion times.  If someone claims to be in one location, but their task completion time doesn't match up, that's a red flag.\n-  I'm happy to share my task completion time for the Medbay scan to help build a more accurate timeline.  This should help eliminate any doubt about our whereabouts.\n-  After we've gone through everyone's accounts, let's discuss any discrepancies and see if we can reach a consensus on who the imposter is.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I was in the cafeteria completing the trash task;

let's go around and have each person state their location and actions during the five minutes before Dave's body was discovered.  This will help us identify any inconsistencies.\n\n-  To help with the timeline, I can confirm I completed my Medbay tasks (Submit Scan and Run Diagnostics) within that five-minute window.  This corroborates Alice and Bob's accounts.\n\n-  It's important that everyone provides specific times for their task completions, if possible, to help us accurately piece together the timeline.  This will make it easier to spot any discrepancies.\n\n-  After we've heard from everyone about their whereabouts, let's focus on comparing those accounts with the task completion times to see if there are any inconsistencies.  This will be key to identifying the imposter.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I was in the cafeteria completing the trash task; anyone else see me there?\n[Bob]: That's great, Erin, I can confirm I saw you in the cafeteria working on the trash task!\n[Alice]: I saw Erin in the cafeteria doing the trash task and Dave fixing wiring;
