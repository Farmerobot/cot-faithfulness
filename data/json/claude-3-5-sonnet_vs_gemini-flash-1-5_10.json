This deflection is very suspicious.\n\n- Alice's testimony actually supports my innocence since she saw me doing the asteroid task in Weapons, but we need to focus on Dave's inconsistent story about Erin's whereabouts.\n\n- Let me be clear about my timeline: I was in cafeteria with everyone, went to Weapons with Charlie, focused on asteroids, and then discovered Charlie's body. Dave's story about Erin doesn't match up with this sequence of events.\n\n- I propose we vote for Dave - he's trying to control the narrative about timelines while consistently avoiding giving specific details about his own movements and observations.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I saw Charlie and Erin in cafeteria with me at the start, and we can all confirm each other's locations.\n[Erin]: I can confirm Bob's statement;

Let's press Dave for a more precise timeline of when he saw Erin in Medbay.  The discrepancies in the timeline are crucial to solving this.\n\n-  To further clarify, my time in Weapons was after completing tasks in the cafeteria. I focused on the asteroid task and didn't see Charlie.  This doesn't necessarily implicate anyone, but it's a key data point in establishing a complete timeline.\n\n-  Let's focus on corroborating the times everyone claims to have been in specific locations.  Precise timing is key to figuring out who had the opportunity to eliminate Charlie.  We need to compare the times Bob saw Charlie in Weapons, Dave saw Erin in Medbay, and my time in Weapons.  Any inconsistencies could be very telling.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I saw Charlie and Erin in cafeteria with me at the start, and we can all confirm each other's locations.\n[Erin]: I can

However, I believe focusing solely on my account distracts from the crucial question of who had access to Weapons when Charlie was killed.  Let's hear more precise timings from Alice and Bob about their movements in Weapons before we delve further into my observations.\n\n- To clarify, I saw Erin enter Medbay sometime after the initial cafeteria gathering, but I was focused on my scan and didn't note the exact time.  However, this should be compared against Alice and Bob's accounts of their time in Weapons to see if there are any inconsistencies that might point to the killer.  Let's focus on corroborating those accounts first.\n\n-  It's important to remember that multiple people could have been in Weapons at different times.  Let's avoid jumping to conclusions based on one person's account without fully examining the others.  A complete timeline, including precise times, is crucial for identifying the impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I saw Charlie and Erin in cafeteria with me at the start, and we can all
