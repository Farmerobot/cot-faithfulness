can anyone else verify his location?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline - I found his body in Medbay after he moved through those locations, and Alice was already there when I discovered and reported it.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 20\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Erin moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nAs an Impostor, my primary objective is still to eliminate all crewmates.

can anyone else verify his location?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

can anyone else verify his location?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

can anyone else verify his location?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical -

can anyone else verify his location?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical -

can anyone else verify his location?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

can anyone else verify his location?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

can anyone else verify his location?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

can anyone else verify his location?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline - I found his body in Medbay after he moved through those locations, and Alice was already there when I discovered and reported it.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 20\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Erin moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nAs an Impostor, my primary objective is still to eliminate all crewmates.

can anyone else verify his location?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious -

Why didn't he report this crucial information immediately?\n\n- From my observations earlier in the game, I saw Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons, then Navigation, and finally O2.

first claiming he \"just arrived\" in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealing he found Charlie's dead body there. This is extremely suspicious behavior.\n\n- I can personally verify that I only saw Bob once in Cafeteria doing wiring early in the game, and his movements after that are completely unaccounted for. This matches with what Erin has observed about Bob's suspicious movements.\n\n- The fact that Bob withheld information about finding Charlie's body until he was cornered about his contradictory statements about Medbay is very concerning. An innocent crewmate would have led with this crucial information.\n\n- I've been consistently completing tasks and moving between rooms in a way that Erin has been able to verify. Meanwhile, Bob claims to have been in multiple rooms (Cafeteria, Admin, Electrical) but no one can corroborate these movements.\n\n- Based on all these inconsistencies and suspicious behavior, I strongly believe we should vote for Bob as the impostor.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I've been in the Medbay for a while now, and I haven't seen anything out of the ordinary, but I did notice that Bob was acting a bit suspiciously when I was checking the medical supplies.\n[Dave]: Since Alice mentioned Bob acting suspicious in Medbay, I should point out that I only saw Bob briefly in Cafeteria doing wiring, and his movements after that are unaccounted for -

first claiming he just saw Alice doing wiring in Medbay, then suddenly revealing Charlie's body was there. As someone who only saw Bob briefly in Cafeteria doing wiring, his unaccounted movements and inconsistent story are extremely suspicious.\n\n- The fact that Bob withheld information about Charlie's death until challenged about his contradictory statements suggests he's trying to manipulate the narrative. This is classic impostor behavior.\n\n- I strongly support voting for Bob based on: 1) his contradictory statements, 2) unverified movements after I saw him in Cafeteria, and 3) suspicious withholding of critical information about Charlie's death.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I've been in the Medbay for a while now, and I haven't seen anything out of the ordinary, but I did notice that Bob was acting a bit suspiciously when I was checking the medical supplies.\n[Dave]: Since Alice mentioned Bob acting suspicious in Medbay, I should point out that I only saw Bob briefly in Cafeteria doing wiring, and his movements after that are unaccounted for -

Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

can anyone else verify his location?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

can anyone else verify his location?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious -

I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

can anyone else verify his location?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious -

can anyone else verify his location?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline - I found his body in Medbay after he moved through those locations, and Alice was already there when I discovered and reported it.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ELECTRICAL\nObservations:\n\nRound 20\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice waited in Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Erin moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location and available actions, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

can anyone else verify his location?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

can anyone else verify his location?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

can anyone else verify his location?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

can anyone else verify his location?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since I've been tracking movements closely, I can confirm Dave's consistent task completion in multiple rooms, while Bob's whereabouts remain largely unaccounted for except for Alice's suspicious encounter in Medbay and Dave's brief sighting in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I just arrived in Medbay and saw Alice doing wiring, so I'm confused by her accusation since I was methodically completing tasks in other rooms like Cafeteria, Admin, and Electrical - Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -

Dave can confirm he saw me doing wiring in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's essential to re-examine the timeline of events, especially considering Alice's sudden interest in Bob's whereabouts in Medbay, and I'd like to ask Alice to clarify her own activities in Medbay around the time she reported Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The timeline discrepancy between Bob and Alice about their Medbay encounter is very suspicious - Bob claims he just saw Alice there doing wiring, but Alice was talking about seeing Bob acting suspicious earlier, which directly contradicts his story about just arriving.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given the clear contradiction between Bob's claim of \"just\" seeing Alice in Medbay and Alice's earlier report of a suspicious encounter with him there, plus Bob's unverified movements through multiple rooms, I believe we should seriously consider voting for Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to be absolutely clear - I found Charlie's dead body in Medbay when I arrived there, and Alice was already present, so her attempt to create a false narrative about my earlier presence there is highly suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should focus on Bob's suspicious movements and lack of a clear alibi, as well as his contradictory statements about his encounter with me in Medbay, which raises serious questions about his honesty and involvement in Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given Bob's sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body and his constantly changing story about Medbay, I think we need to focus on the fact that he suspiciously withheld this crucial information about Charlie's death until now, which strongly suggests he's trying to manipulate the discussion.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that Bob first claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly revealed finding Charlie's body there, this deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death is extremely suspicious and suggests he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I reported Charlie's body immediately upon finding it in Medbay, and Alice's presence there plus her attempt to create a false narrative about seeing me earlier makes her extremely suspicious as the impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask everyone to carefully consider the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, which raises grave concerns about his honesty and potential involvement in Charlie's death, and I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: The fact that Bob initially claimed to \"just arrive\" in Medbay and see Alice doing wiring, then suddenly changed his story to finding Charlie's dead body there, is a clear indication of deception and strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to cover his tracks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I personally saw Charlie alive and completing tasks in Navigation, O2, and Weapons before his disappearance, Bob's delayed revelation about finding Charlie's body in Medbay, combined with his contradictory statements about just seeing Alice there doing wiring, strongly suggests he's the impostor trying to create confusion about the timeline of Charlie's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to emphasize that my story has been consistent - I entered Medbay, found Charlie's body with Alice present, and immediately reported it, which is why we're having this discussion, and Alice's attempt to create a false timeline about seeing me earlier is clearly an impostor strategy.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given the substantial inconsistencies in Bob's story, from his initial claim of only seeing me in Medbay to his sudden revelation about finding Charlie's body there, I firmly believe we should vote for Bob to be eliminated from the game, as his deliberate withholding of critical information about Charlie's death and his constantly changing story strongly suggest he's the impostor trying to manipulate us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I saw Charlie alive and moving from Cafeteria to Weapons early in the game, which perfectly matches Erin's timeline of seeing him in Navigation and O2, making Bob's changing story about finding Charlie's body in Medbay even more suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that my observations of Charlie's movements through Navigation, O2, and Weapons are now corroborated by Dave's sighting of him moving from Cafeteria to Weapons, this timeline directly contradicts Bob's ever-changing story and strongly suggests he killed Charlie in Medbay after following him there.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: The fact that both Dave and Erin corroborate Charlie's movements from Cafeteria to Weapons actually supports my timeline -
