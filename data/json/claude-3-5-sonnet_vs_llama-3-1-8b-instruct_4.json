It's essential to prioritize social interaction and get a feel for the group's dynamics. Charlie should wait in Medbay to observe any potential behavior that might indicate an impostor.\n\n2. **Review objectives and decide on the next course of action**: After observing Dave and Bob for a bit, Charlie should review the current objectives and decide which one is the most pressing. Considering the limited time left and the available actions, Charlie should select the most critical task that aligns with their current location.\n\n3. **Move to the identified location and perform the related action**: Based on the chosen objective, Charlie should move to the corresponding location and perform the related action. This might involve proceeding to a different area, such as the Upper Engine, or staying in Medbay to complete a task.\n\n4. **Assess the situation and adjust the plan accordingly**: After completing the assigned task or moving to a new location, Charlie should reassess the situation and adjust their plan accordingly. This might involve changing their focus to another task or adjusting their strategy to counter any potential impostors.\n\nThis plan focuses on social interaction, objective review, and task completion, all while adapting to the current game state and available actions.", "wait in medbay", "Here's a plan for Charlie, the crewmate:\n\n1. **Wait in Medbay**: Since waiting in Medbay doesn't require any new actions or locations, and it doesn't conflict with any upcoming objectives, this is the most straightforward next step.\n2. **Move to location Admin**: After completing the waiting step, Charlie should head to Admin to clean the floor, which is another high-priority objective. This is one of the two remaining actions that need to be done to finish the game, and Admin is relatively close to Medbay.\n3. **Move to location Upper Engine**: After cleaning the floor, Charlie will move to Upper Engine, where one of the final objectives is located. Fixing the catalyzer in the upper engine should be a top priority with only 2 turns left to finish the game.\n\nThis plan focuses on prioritizing the current objectives, moving to nearby locations that are conducive to future actions, and attempting to make progress towards the final two objectives. It also does not require moving to the Cafeteria at this stage, which was a crucial location in earlier rounds, but is less relevant with the current location and upcoming objectives.", "wait in medbay", "Based on the current game state and available actions, here is a plan for Charlie:\n\n1. **Wait in Medbay**: It's essential to stay in Medbay to submit the scan and progress towards completing the objective.
