understand that both Alice and I were in Medbay doing tasks, but we can't ignore the fact that I saw you, Charlie, eliminate Bob right in front of us, which is why we should be focusing on your actions instead of deflecting blame.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave is trying to shift the blame onto me, but I was with both of you in Medbay the whole time, and we should really focus on figuring out where Erin went after Cafeteria since she hasn't been seen, which could be crucial in identifying the real impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it concerning that Dave is adamant about Charlie being the impostor when we were all together in Medbay; instead, we should prioritize locating Erin since her absence could provide vital clues about the impostor's identity.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your attempts to redirect our focus onto Erin are concerning, especially since I witnessed you eliminate Bob right in front of me; we need to prioritize discussing your actions instead of deflecting attention.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's insistence on blaming me seems more like a tactic to divert suspicion away from himself, especially since Alice and I can vouch for each other being in Medbay, so let's

it troubling that Dave is fixated on blaming Charlie, especially since both Charlie and I were together in Medbay, and we should redirect our focus to Erin's suspicious absence, which could hold the key to uncovering the impostor among us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, your attempts to shift the blame and focus on Erin only highlight your guilt, especially since I witnessed you eliminate Bob; we must prioritize voting you out to protect the remaining crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's frantic accusations are becoming increasingly suspicious, and instead of focusing solely on me, we should prioritize finding Erin, as her absence could provide crucial insights into who the real impostor
