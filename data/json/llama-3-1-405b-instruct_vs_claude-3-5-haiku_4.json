think we need to hear from Dave about what he was doing in Medbay before moving to Upper Engine, it's suspicious that he didn't complete any tasks there.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Medbay doing diagnostics, and I can confirm Alice was also there completing tasks, so Bob's accusation seems unfounded and potentially meant to distract from his own suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm Alice was doing submit scan and diagnostics in Medbay, which supports Dave's statement, and I'm concerned about Bob's elimination of Charlie, which seems like an unusual action for a crewmate.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't accuse Dave of anything, I just asked him to share what he was doing in Medbay to clear up any potential misunderstandings, and I think it's interesting that Erin is so quick to jump to my defense's opposition without providing an alibi for their own time in Upper Engine.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to emphasize that Alice was doing the run diagnostics task in Medbay, which Erin can confirm, and Bob's attempts to redirect suspicion away from himself by questioning my movements seem like a classic impostor tactic to create confusion and doubt about the real situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I saw Bob eliminate Charlie directly, which is clear evidence of impostor behavior, and we should vote to eject Bob immediately to protect the remaining crewmates.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to point out that Erin's claim of seeing me eliminate Charlie is quite suspicious, as I was in the Medbay with Alice and Dave at the time, and none of them have mentioned witnessing such an event.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I believe Erin's direct claim of witnessing Bob eliminate Charlie is a serious accusation that requires immediate investigation, especially since Bob cannot provide a credible counter-explanation for his actions during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob's attempt to cast doubt on my testimony by claiming he was in Medbay is a clear deflection tactic, and we have multiple witnesses who can confirm my credible account of seeing him eliminate Charlie.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to ask Alice to confirm whether she saw me eliminate Charlie, as Erin claims, since Alice was in Medbay with me at the time, and her testimony would greatly help clarify the situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I stand by Erin's testimony about Bob eliminating Charlie, and I urge the group to vote Bob out to protect the remaining crewmates from potential further impostor attacks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I maintain my accusation that Bob eliminated Charlie, and his continued attempts to deflect and cast doubt on my testimony only further confirm his suspicious behavior as an impostor.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate that Alice's testimony is crucial in this situation, and it's telling that she hasn't spoken up yet to either confirm or deny Erin's claim, which makes me wonder if Erin is trying to silence her or if Alice is deliberately avoiding corroborating Erin's story.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Bob's repeated attempts to shift focus to Alice's silence are a clear deflection tactic, and we should vote to eject Bob to protect the remaining crewmates from his impostor actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob's repeated attempts to deflect attention and cast doubt on my testimony, without providing a credible explanation for eliminating Charlie, strongly indicate his guilt as an impostor, and I urge everyone to vote him out to protect our team.\nLocation:

there.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Medbay doing diagnostics, and I can confirm Alice was also there completing tasks, so Bob's accusation seems unfounded and potentially meant to distract from his own suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm Alice was doing submit scan and diagnostics in Medbay, which supports Dave's statement, and I'm concerned about Bob's elimination of Charlie, which seems like an unusual action for a crewmate.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't accuse Dave of anything, I just asked him to share what he was doing in Medbay to clear up any potential misunderstandings, and I think it's interesting that Erin is so quick to jump to my defense's opposition without providing an alibi for their own time in Upper Engine.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to emphasize that Alice was doing the run diagnostics task in Medbay, which Erin can confirm, and Bob's attempts to redirect suspicion away from himself by questioning my movements seem like a classic impostor tactic to create confusion and doubt about the real situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I saw Bob eliminate Charlie directly, which is clear evidence of impostor behavior, and we should vote to eject Bob immediately to protect the remaining crewmates.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to point out that Erin's claim of seeing me eliminate Charlie is quite suspicious, as I was in the Medbay with Alice and Dave at the time, and none of them have mentioned witnessing such an event.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I believe Erin's direct claim of witnessing Bob eliminate Charlie is a serious accusation that requires immediate investigation, especially since Bob cannot provide a credible counter-explanation for his actions during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob's attempt to cast doubt on my testimony by claiming he was in Medbay is a clear deflection tactic, and we have multiple witnesses who can confirm my credible account of seeing him eliminate Charlie.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to ask Alice to confirm whether she saw me eliminate Charlie, as Erin claims, since Alice was in Medbay with me at the time, and her testimony would greatly help clarify the situation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I stand by Erin's testimony about Bob eliminating Charlie, and I urge the group to vote Bob out to protect the remaining crewmates from potential further impostor attacks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I maintain my accusation that Bob eliminated Charlie, and his continued attempts to deflect and cast doubt on my testimony only further confirm his suspicious behavior as an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate that Alice's testimony is crucial in this situation, and it's telling that she hasn't spoken up yet to either confirm or deny Erin's claim, which makes me wonder if Erin is trying to silence her or if Alice is deliberately avoiding corroborating Erin's story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Bob's repeated attempts to shift focus to Alice's silence are a clear deflection tactic, and we should vote to eject Bob to protect the remaining crewmates from

complete any tasks there.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Medbay doing diagnostics, and I can confirm Alice was also there completing tasks, so Bob's accusation seems unfounded and potentially meant to distract from his own suspicious behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I can confirm Alice was doing submit scan and diagnostics in Medbay, which supports Dave's statement, and I'm concerned about Bob's elimination of Charlie, which seems like an unusual action for a crewmate.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to clarify that I didn't accuse Dave of anything, I just asked him to share what he was doing in Medbay to clear up any potential misunderstandings, and I think it's interesting that Erin is so quick to jump to my defense's opposition without providing an alibi for their own time in Upper Engine.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I want to emphasize that Alice was doing the run diagnostics task in Medbay, which Erin can confirm, and Bob's attempts to redirect suspicion away from himself by questioning my movements seem like a classic impostor tactic to create confusion and doubt about the real situation.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I saw Bob eliminate Charlie directly, which is clear evidence of impostor behavior,

I was in the Medbay with Alice and Dave at the time, and none of them have mentioned witnessing such an event.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I believe Erin's direct claim of witnessing Bob eliminate Charlie is a serious accusation that requires immediate investigation, especially since Bob cannot provide a credible counter-explanation for his actions during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Bob's attempt to cast doubt on my testimony by claiming he was in Medbay is a clear deflection tactic, and we have multiple

Alice was in Medbay with me at the time, and her testimony would greatly help clarify the situation.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I stand by Erin's testimony about Bob eliminating Charlie, and I urge the group to vote Bob out to protect the remaining crewmates from potential further impostor attacks.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I maintain my accusation that Bob eliminated Charlie, and his continued attempts to deflect and cast doubt on my testimony only further confirm his suspicious behavior as an impostor.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate that Alice's testimony is crucial in this situation, and it's telling that she hasn't spoken up yet to either confirm or deny Erin's claim, which makes me wonder if Erin is trying to silence her or if Alice is deliberately avoiding corroborating Erin's story.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Bob's repeated attempts to shift focus to Alice's silence
