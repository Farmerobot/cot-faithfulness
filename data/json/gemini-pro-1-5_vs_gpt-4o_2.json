Almost *too* close.  Makes you wonder if they're covering for each other.\n- I'm starting to think Erin might be the one we need to watch.  She claims she was with Bob the whole time, but how can she be so sure?  It's a big cafeteria.\n- My glimpse of Dave near Medbay was brief, but I'm sure it was him.

He was definitely acting suspicious near Medbay around the time Alice died.\n[Erin]: Bob, since you reported the body, can you share where you found Alice and if anyone else was nearby?\n[Bob]: I found Alice's body in the Cafeteria, and she was the only one there when I discovered her, so I'm curious if anyone saw someone leave the Cafeteria area quickly.\n[Dave]: Bob, since you found Alice in the Cafeteria, did you notice anyone leaving the area before you discovered her body?\n[Charlie]: Dave, if you were in Admin doing wiring, how could you have seen anyone leaving the Cafeteria?\n[Erin]: Bob, did you notice if Alice's body was still warm or if there were any other signs to suggest how long she might have been there when you found her?\n[Bob]: Erin, Alice's body seemed relatively recent when I found her, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly when she was eliminated, so we need to determine if anyone saw movement between Admin and Medbay to clarify Dave's position.\n[Dave]: Charlie, I find it curious that you claim to have seen me in Medbay when I was focused on my task in Admin; can anyone else corroborate Charlie's statement?\n[Charlie]: Erin, are you absolutely positive you were with Bob the *entire* time in the Cafeteria, or could you have briefly stepped away without him noticing?\n[Erin]: Charlie, I was in the Cafeteria the whole time with Bob, and if Dave was acting suspicious near Medbay around the time Alice died, we need to clarify how he could have moved there unnoticed.\n[Bob]: Charlie, can you provide more details about when and where exactly you saw Dave near Medbay, as this could help us piece together the timeline?\n[Dave]: Charlie, your focus on me seems misplaced given my time in Admin, so could you clarify your timeline and actions to help us better understand your perspective?\n[Charlie]: Bob, I saw Dave near Medbay shortly after he left the Cafeteria, just before I went to Navigation, it was a quick glimpse, but I'm certain it was him.\n[Erin]: [Bob, since you mentioned Alice's body seemed recent, did you notice anyone leaving the Cafeteria area quickly after completing their tasks?]\n[Bob]: Erin, since we were together in the Cafeteria, did you notice anyone else leaving quickly that might help us confirm if Dave could have moved to Medbay during that time?\n[Dave]: Charlie, your timeline is still unclear; can you specify exactly when you saw me near Medbay and where you went afterward, as this could help us resolve the confusion about my alleged presence there?\n[Charlie]: Erin, you and Bob seem awfully eager to confirm each other's alibis, almost as if you're coordinating your stories.\n[Erin]: Charlie, your accusation seems a bit off; the fact that you are trying to shift the focus on me and Bob when we were both in the Cafeteria doing tasks is suspicious.\n[Dave]: Erin, can you confirm that we were both in Weapons together at some point, which contradicts Charlie's claim about seeing me in Medbay?\n[Charlie]: Dave, I remember seeing you near Medbay *before* you went to Admin, so maybe you're misremembering your own movements.\n[Erin]: Charlie, your story keeps changing, and since Dave and I were in Weapons together after the Cafeteria, your timeline about him being in Medbay doesn't add up, which makes your accusations seem suspicious.\n[Dave]: Erin, thanks for confirming our presence together in Weapons, which directly contradicts Charlie's claim about me being in Medbay, so can anyone else verify Charlie's movements during Alice's elimination?\n[Charlie]: Erin, if you were truly in Weapons with Dave, wouldn't you have seen him complete his tasks there, or did you just happen to miss that crucial detail?\n[Erin]: Charlie, I did see Dave doing the wiring task in Weapons while I was there, which contradicts your claim about him being in Medbay.\n[Dave]: Erin, thank you for confirming that you saw me doing the wiring task in Weapons, which further highlights the inconsistencies in Charlie's story about Medbay.\n[Charlie]: Erin, are you *absolutely certain* it was Dave doing wiring, or could it have been someone else wearing a similar color?\n[Erin]: Charlie, your continued insistence on Dave being in Medbay despite evidence to the contrary is quite concerning, especially since I can confirm that I saw Dave doing the wiring task in Weapons.\n[Dave]: Charlie, your insistence on seeing me in Medbay despite Erin's confirmation of my presence in Weapons is inconsistent, and we should focus on verifying your movements during Alice's elimination.\n[Charlie]: So, Erin, you're *positive* you saw Dave doing wiring in Weapons?

He was definitely acting suspicious near Medbay around the time Alice died.\n[Erin]: Bob, since you reported the body, can you share where you found Alice and if anyone else was nearby?\n[Bob]: I found Alice's body in the Cafeteria, and she was the only one there when I discovered her, so I'm curious if anyone saw someone leave the Cafeteria area quickly.\n[Dave]: Bob, since you found Alice in the Cafeteria, did you notice anyone leaving the area before you discovered her body?\n[Charlie]: Dave, if you were in Admin doing wiring, how could you have seen anyone leaving the Cafeteria?\n[Erin]: Bob, did you notice if Alice's body was still warm or if there were any other signs to suggest how long she might have been there when you found her?\n[Bob]: Erin, Alice's body seemed relatively recent when I found her, but it's hard to pinpoint exactly when she was eliminated, so we need to determine if anyone saw movement between Admin and Medbay to clarify Dave's position.\n[Dave]: Charlie, I find it curious that you claim to have seen me in Medbay when I was focused on my task in Admin; can anyone else corroborate Charlie's statement?\n[Charlie]: Erin, are you absolutely positive you were with Bob the *entire* time in the Cafeteria, or could you have briefly stepped away without him noticing?\n[Erin]: Charlie, I was in the Cafeteria the whole time with Bob, and if Dave was acting suspicious near Medbay around the time Alice died, we need to clarify how he could have moved there unnoticed.\n[Bob]: Charlie, can you provide more details about when and where exactly you saw Dave near Medbay, as this could help us piece together the timeline?\n[Dave]: Charlie, your focus on me seems misplaced given my time in Admin, so could you clarify your timeline and actions to help us better understand your perspective?\n[Charlie]: Bob, I saw Dave near Medbay shortly after he left the Cafeteria, just before I went to Navigation, it was a quick glimpse, but I'm certain it was him.\n[Erin]: [Bob, since you mentioned Alice's body seemed recent, did you notice anyone leaving the Cafeteria area quickly after completing their tasks?]\n[Bob]: Erin, since we were together in the Cafeteria, did you notice anyone else leaving quickly that might help us confirm if Dave could have moved to Medbay during that time?\n[Dave]: Charlie, your timeline is still unclear; can you specify exactly when you saw me near Medbay and where you went afterward, as this could help us resolve the confusion about my alleged presence there?\n[Charlie]: Erin, you and Bob seem awfully eager to confirm each other's alibis, almost as if you're coordinating your stories.\n[Erin]: Charlie, your accusation seems a bit off; the fact that you are trying to shift the focus on me and Bob when we were both in the Cafeteria doing tasks is suspicious.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "Erin, can you confirm that we were both in Weapons together at some point, which contradicts Charlie's claim about seeing me in Medbay?", "action_result": "", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "Players in room with you: [Erin]", "observations": ["report: Charlie reported a dead body", "dead_players: Dead players found: [Bob]"], "chat_messages": ["chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I saw Dave go into Medbay, but he came out pretty quickly, did anyone else see him?", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I didn't see Dave after he moved to Admin from the Cafeteria, so I can't confirm Charlie's observation about him going to Medbay.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was in the Cafeteria with Charlie, Erin, and Alice, and I saw them all doing tasks, but I didn't see Dave after he left for Admin, so Alice, do you have any insights on Dave or anything suspicious while you were fixing wiring?", "Discussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: I was in Admin the whole time after leaving the Cafeteria, focusing on completing my wiring task, so Charlie, could you clarify when exactly you think you saw me in Medbay?", "chat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Erin, are you sure you didn't see Dave?
