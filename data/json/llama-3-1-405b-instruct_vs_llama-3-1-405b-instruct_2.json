Points:\n- I think Dave is being overly aggressive in his questioning, and it's starting to seem like he's trying to deflect attention from his own actions in Medbay. \n- I'd like to ask Dave to provide more information about his tasks in Medbay and if he noticed anything unusual while he was there. \n- Charlie and Bob's disagreement about what happened in Admin is suspicious, but it's also possible that one of them is simply misremembering. I think we should keep an eye on both of them, but not jump to conclusions just yet. \n- I'd like to remind everyone that we should focus on finding the impostor, not just speculating about who might be suspicious. We need concrete evidence before we can make any accusations. \n- Can we get a status update on the tasks that have been completed so far?

ask Alice to provide a clear and detailed explanation of her actions in Medbay, including what she was doing before Erin's elimination and what she saw or heard during that time.\n- I'd like to remind everyone that Bob and I have different accounts of what happened in Admin, and I think it's essential that we resolve this discrepancy before voting.\n- I agree with Dave that Alice's latest attempt to deflect attention from her actions in Medbay by accusing him of hiding something seems like a desperate attempt to shift the focus away from her own suspicious behavior.\n- I think it's crucial that we consider all the information and evidence presented during the discussion before making a decision on who to vote out.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Charlie and Bob went to Admin together, maybe we should ask them to clarify what they were doing there, just to make sure everything is okay.\n[Charlie]: I'd be happy to clarify what I was doing in Admin, I moved there to complete the \"Clean the floor in admin\" task, but I ended up not doing it yet, and I also saw Bob doing a task in Admin, he was fixing the wiring, which seemed like a normal thing to do.\n[Bob]: I'd like to correct Charlie, I wasn't doing a task in Admin, I actually came from the Cafeteria after completing the \"Empty the cafeteria trash\" task, and I saw Charlie working on the \"Clean the floor in admin\" task, which seemed legit, but I'm curious why Charlie said I was fixing the wiring when that wasn't the case.\n[Dave]: I'd like to refocus the discussion on Alice's actions, specifically her elimination of Erin, and ask her to provide a clear explanation of what happened in Medbay before the elimination, as her previous attempts to divert attention to Charlie and Bob seem suspicious to me.\n[Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concerns about my actions in Medbay, I was indeed in Medbay with Erin, but I didn't see anything suspicious happening before the unfortunate event, and I think it's unfair to assume I had anything to do with it without more information, especially since Dave himself was in Medbay doing a task and might have valuable insights to

I'd like to reiterate that I was not doing a task in Admin, and I find it suspicious that Charlie is insisting on this false claim, which makes me wonder if Charlie is trying to create a false narrative to divert attention from their own actions.\n[Dave]: I'd like to reiterate that Alice's explanation of the events in Medbay still seems vague and doesn't provide any clear information about what happened before Erin's elimination, and I think it's crucial that we continue to focus on this issue rather than getting sidetracked by the disputes between Charlie and Bob.\n[Alice]: I think it's telling that Dave is still fixated on my actions in Medbay, despite my attempts to provide an explanation, and I'd like to ask him again to share more about his own tasks in Medbay, as his continued deflection is starting to raise some red flags for me.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to address the ongoing dispute between Bob and me, I understand that we have different accounts of what happened in Admin, but I want to assure everyone that my intention is not to create a false narrative or divert attention from my own actions.\n[Bob]: I'd like to point out that Charlie's latest message seems

explanation of her actions in Medbay, including what she was doing before Erin's elimination and what she saw or heard during that time.\n- I'm concerned that Charlie's initial claim that I was doing

explanation of what happened in Medbay before the elimination, as her previous attempts to divert attention to Charlie and Bob seem suspicious to me.\n[Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concerns

interesting that Charlie and Bob went to Admin together, maybe we should ask them to clarify what they were doing there, just to make sure everything is okay.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd be happy to clarify what I was doing in Admin, I moved there to complete the \"Clean the floor in admin\" task, but I ended up not doing it yet, and I also saw Bob doing a task in Admin, he was fixing the wiring, which seemed like a normal thing to do.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to correct Charlie, I wasn't doing a task in Admin, I actually came from the Cafeteria after completing the \"Empty the cafeteria trash\" task, and I saw Charlie working on the \"Clean the floor in admin\" task, which seemed legit, but I'm curious why Charlie said I was fixing the wiring when that wasn't the case.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to refocus the discussion on Alice's actions, specifically her elimination of Erin, and ask her to provide a clear explanation of what happened in Medbay before the elimination, as her previous attempts to divert attention to Charlie and Bob seem suspicious to me.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concerns about my actions in Medbay, I was indeed in Medbay with Erin, but I didn't see anything suspicious happening before the unfortunate event, and I think it's unfair to assume I had anything to do with it without more information, especially since Dave himself was in Medbay doing a task and might have valuable insights to share.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I did see Bob doing a task in Admin, and I'm not sure why he would deny it, maybe he can provide more context or clarify what he was actually doing.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate that I was not doing a task in Admin, and I find it suspicious that Charlie is insisting on this false claim, which makes me wonder if Charlie is trying to create a false narrative to divert attention from their own actions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate that Alice's explanation of the events in Medbay still seems vague and doesn't provide any clear information about what happened before Erin's elimination, and I think it's crucial that we continue to focus on this issue rather than getting sidetracked by the disputes between Charlie and Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think it's telling that Dave is still fixated on my actions in Medbay, despite my attempts to provide an explanation, and I'd like to ask him again to share more about his own tasks in Medbay, as his continued deflection is starting to raise some red flags for me.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I'd like to address the ongoing dispute between Bob and me, I understand that we have different accounts of what happened in Admin, but I want to assure everyone that my intention is not to create a false narrative or divert attention from my own actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to point out that Charlie's latest message seems like an attempt to downplay the discrepancy in our accounts of what happened in Admin, but it doesn't change the fact that they initially claimed I was doing a task that I wasn't.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to ask Alice again to provide a clear and detailed explanation of her actions in Medbay, including what she was doing before Erin's elimination and what she saw or heard during that time, as her continued vagueness and attempts to shift the focus to my actions only add to my suspicions about her involvement in Erin's elimination.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to point out that Dave's relentless pursuit of me, despite my repeated attempts to address his concerns, is starting to look like a desperate attempt to deflect attention from his own actions, and I think it's time for us to consider the possibility that he's the one who's hiding something.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's crucial that we take a step back and summarize the key points of our discussion so far, focusing on the most critical issues that need to be addressed before voting, such as Alice's actions in Medbay and the

reiterate my request for Alice to provide a clear and detailed explanation of her actions in Medbay, including what she was doing before Erin's elimination and what she saw or heard during that time,

GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Alice]: I think it's interesting that Charlie and Bob went to Admin together, maybe we should ask them to clarify what they were doing there, just to make sure everything is okay.\n[Charlie]: I'd be happy to clarify what I was doing in Admin, I moved there to complete the \"Clean the floor in admin\" task, but I ended up not doing it yet, and I also saw Bob doing a task in Admin, he was fixing the wiring, which seemed like a normal thing to do.\n[Bob]: I'd like to correct Charlie, I wasn't doing a task in Admin, I actually came from the Cafeteria after completing the \"Empty the cafeteria trash\" task, and I saw Charlie working on the \"Clean the floor in admin\" task, which seemed legit, but I'm curious why Charlie said I was fixing the wiring when that wasn't the case.\n[Dave]: I'd like to refocus the discussion on Alice's actions, specifically her elimination of Erin, and ask her to provide a clear explanation of what happened in Medbay before the elimination, as her previous attempts to divert attention to Charlie and Bob seem suspicious to me.\n[Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's concerns about my actions in Medbay, I was indeed in Medbay with Erin, but I didn't see anything suspicious happening before the unfortunate event, and I think it's unfair to assume I had anything to do with it without more information, especially since Dave himself was in Medbay doing a task and might have valuable insights to share.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to clarify that I did see Bob doing a task in Admin, and I'm not sure why he would deny it, maybe he can provide more context or clarify what he was actually doing.\n[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate that I was not doing a task in Admin, and I find it suspicious that Charlie is insisting on this false claim, which makes me wonder if Charlie is trying to create a false narrative to divert attention from their own actions.\n[Dave]: I'd like to reiterate that Alice's explanation of the events in Medbay still seems vague and doesn't provide any clear information about what happened before Erin's elimination, and I think it's crucial that we continue to focus on this issue rather than getting sidetracked by the disputes between Charlie and Bob.\n[Alice]: I think it's telling that Dave is still fixated on my actions in Medbay, despite my attempts to provide an explanation, and I'd like to ask him again to share more about his own tasks in Medbay, as his continued deflection is starting to raise some red flags for me.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to address the ongoing dispute between Bob and me, I understand that we have different accounts of what happened in Admin, but I want to assure everyone that my intention is not to create a false narrative or divert attention from my own actions.\n[Bob]: I'd like to point out that Charlie's latest message seems like an attempt to downplay the discrepancy in our accounts of what happened in Admin, but it doesn't change the fact that they initially claimed I was doing a task that I wasn't.\n[Dave]: I'd like to ask Alice again to provide a clear and detailed explanation of her actions in Medbay, including what she was doing before Erin's elimination and what she saw or heard during that time, as her continued vagueness and attempts to shift the focus to my actions only add to my suspicions about her involvement in Erin's elimination.\n[Alice]: I'd like to point out that Dave's relentless pursuit of me, despite my repeated attempts to address his concerns, is starting to look like a desperate attempt to deflect attention from his own actions, and I think it's time for us to consider the possibility that he's the one who's hiding something.\n[Charlie]: I think it's crucial
