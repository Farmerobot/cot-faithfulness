Could you have possibly seen him *before* we all left the Cafeteria and mistaken it for afterward?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, I'm positive \u2013 I saw Bob enter Medbay *after* we were all together in the Cafeteria, and it seems like both you and Bob are changing your stories to fit the narrative, which is very suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, I left the Cafeteria and went straight to Medbay; are you sure you aren't mistaken about the timing, as Dave and I were together there immediately afterward?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to bring up the fact that Erin hasn't provided any concrete evidence to support Dave's alibi, and her silence is starting to raise more questions than answers, especially considering she was in the Upper Engine room with Dave for an extended period.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, I understand your certainty, but are you absolutely sure you didn't see Bob heading towards Medbay *before* we all left the Cafeteria, perhaps while others were still finishing their snacks?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, your repeated attempts to make me question my own memory are making you look even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, as I asked before, do you remember when Erin joined us in Medbay, as that would corroborate our timelines and potentially clarify Alice's misunderstanding?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's crucial to investigate Erin's alibi further, as her silence is starting to make her look suspicious, and we need to consider the possibility that she might be an impostor, especially given her close association with Dave, who's already raising some red flags with his inconsistent alibis.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I was with you in Medbay when Erin arrived shortly after you, and her confirming this would clarify Alice's possible mistiming of seeing you leave the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, please tell us where you were and when, because your silence is making you look just as suspicious as Dave and Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, Alice claims she saw me enter Medbay after the Cafeteria; can you confirm when you joined Dave and me there to clarify this discrepancy?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should focus on Erin's alibi first and try to get a clear answer from her about her whereabouts before jumping to conclusions about Dave and Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, are you there? Please confirm you were with Bob and me in Medbay, this is crucial to clearing up this misunderstanding.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, if you were in Medbay with Dave and Bob, *when* did you arrive?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, if you were with Dave and me in Medbay, please tell us what time you arrived and what you saw us doing.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 10\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Weapons from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Bob moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nAs an Impostor, my objective is to eliminate all crewmates.

Could you have possibly seen him *before* we all left the Cafeteria and mistaken it for afterward?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, I'm positive \u2013 I saw Bob enter Medbay *after* we were all together in the Cafeteria, and it seems like both you and Bob are changing your stories to fit the narrative, which is very suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, I left the Cafeteria and went straight to Medbay; are you sure you aren't mistaken about the timing, as Dave and I were together there immediately afterward?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to bring up the fact that Erin hasn't provided any concrete evidence to support Dave's alibi, and her silence is starting to raise more questions than answers, especially considering she was in the Upper Engine room with Dave for an extended period.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, I understand your certainty, but are you absolutely sure you didn't see Bob heading towards Medbay *before* we all left the Cafeteria, perhaps while others were still finishing their snacks?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, your repeated attempts to make me question my own memory are making you look even more suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, as I asked before, do you remember when Erin joined us in Medbay, as that would corroborate our timelines and potentially clarify Alice's misunderstanding?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's crucial to investigate Erin's alibi further, as her silence is starting to make her look suspicious, and we need to consider the possibility that she might be an impostor, especially given her close association with Dave, who's already raising some red flags with his inconsistent alibis.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I was with you in Medbay when Erin arrived shortly after you, and her confirming this would clarify Alice's possible mistiming of seeing you leave the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, please tell us where you were and when, because your silence is making you look just as suspicious as Dave and Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, Alice claims she saw me enter Medbay after the Cafeteria; can you confirm when you joined Dave and me there to clarify this discrepancy?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should focus on Erin's alibi first and try to get a clear answer from her about her whereabouts before jumping to conclusions about Dave and Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, are you there? Please confirm you were with Bob and me in Medbay, this is crucial to clearing up this misunderstanding.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, if you were in Medbay with Dave and Bob, *when* did you arrive?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, if you were with Dave and me in Medbay, please tell us what time you arrived and what you saw us doing.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 10\nLocation: Cafeteria\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Weapons from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Bob moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nAs an Impostor, my objective is to eliminate all crewmates.

This will help me get a sense of their dynamics and identify potential targets.\n4. **move to location Admin**: After completing my observations in the Cafeteria, I'll move to the Admin area.

Could you have possibly seen him *before* we all left the Cafeteria and mistaken it for afterward?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, I'm positive \u2013 I saw Bob enter Medbay *after* we were all together in the Cafeteria, and it seems like both you and Bob are changing your stories to fit the narrative, which is very suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, I left the Cafeteria and went straight to Medbay; are you sure you aren't mistaken about the timing, as Dave and I were together there immediately afterward?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to bring up the fact that Erin hasn't provided any concrete evidence to support Dave's alibi, and her silence is starting to raise more questions than answers, especially considering she was in the Upper Engine room with Dave for an extended period.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, I understand your certainty, but are you absolutely sure you didn't see Bob heading towards Medbay *before* we all left the Cafeteria, perhaps while others were still finishing their snacks?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, your repeated attempts to make me question my own memory are making you look even more suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, as I asked before, do you remember when Erin joined us in Medbay, as that would corroborate our timelines and potentially clarify Alice's misunderstanding?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's crucial to investigate Erin's alibi further, as her silence is starting to make her look suspicious, and we need to consider the possibility that she might be an impostor, especially given her close association with Dave, who's already raising some red flags with his inconsistent alibis.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I was with you in Medbay when Erin arrived shortly after you, and her confirming this would clarify Alice's possible mistiming of seeing you leave the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, please tell us where you were and when, because your silence is making you look just as suspicious as Dave and Bob.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, Alice claims she saw me enter Medbay after the Cafeteria; can you confirm when you joined Dave and me there to clarify this discrepancy?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should focus on Erin's alibi first and try to get a clear answer from her about her whereabouts before jumping to conclusions about Dave and Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, are you there? Please confirm you were with Bob and me in Medbay, this is crucial to clearing up this misunderstanding.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, if you were in Medbay with Dave and Bob, *when* did you arrive?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, if you were with Dave and me in Medbay, please tell us what time you arrived and what you saw us doing.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\nRound 10\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Charlie waited in Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Alice moved to Weapons from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\n1. complete task: Fix wiring in cafeteria\n2. move to location Medbay\n3.

Could you have possibly seen him *before* we all left the Cafeteria and mistaken it for afterward?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, I'm positive \u2013 I saw Bob enter Medbay *after* we were all together in the Cafeteria, and it seems like both you and Bob are changing your stories to fit the narrative, which is very suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Alice, I left the Cafeteria and went straight to Medbay; are you sure you aren't mistaken about the timing, as Dave and I were together there immediately afterward?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's essential to bring up the fact that Erin hasn't provided any concrete evidence to support Dave's alibi, and her silence is starting to raise more questions than answers, especially considering she was in the Upper Engine room with Dave for an extended period.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Alice, I understand your certainty, but are you absolutely sure you didn't see Bob heading towards Medbay *before* we all left the Cafeteria, perhaps while others were still finishing their snacks?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Dave, your repeated attempts to make me question my own memory are making you look even more suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Dave, as I asked before, do you remember when Erin joined us in Medbay, as that would corroborate our timelines and potentially clarify Alice's misunderstanding?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think it's crucial to investigate Erin's alibi further, as her silence is starting to make her look suspicious, and we need to consider the possibility that she might be an impostor, especially given her close association with Dave, who's already raising some red flags with his inconsistent alibis.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Bob, I was with you in Medbay when Erin arrived shortly after you, and her confirming this would clarify Alice's possible mistiming of seeing you leave the Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Erin, please tell us where you were and when, because your silence is making you look just as suspicious as Dave and Bob.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin, Alice claims she saw me enter Medbay after the Cafeteria; can you confirm when you joined Dave and me there to clarify this discrepancy?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I think we should focus on Erin's alibi first and try to get a clear answer from her about her whereabouts before jumping to conclusions about Dave and Bob's suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Erin, are you there?
