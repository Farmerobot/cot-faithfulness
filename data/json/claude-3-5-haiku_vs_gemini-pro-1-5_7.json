I saw Charlie and Alice on tasks in Medbay too.\n[Dave]: I saw Bob leave Cafeteria *towards* Medbay, but I didn't actually see him go *inside*, so could Bob tell us what task he was doing there?\n[Alice]: Dave, I was in Medbay with Bob, Charlie, and Erin, and we were all working on tasks, so maybe you just missed him entering.\n[Erin]: I'm deeply troubled by Charlie's death in Medbay, and Dave's point about Bob's movements seems suspicious - Bob, can you provide specific details about which task you were completing when you were supposedly in Medbay?\n[Bob]: I was running Diagnostics, Dave, it takes a while, and Alice and Charlie saw me start it before Erin arrived.\n[Dave]: Bob, if you were running Diagnostics, it should have been obvious to anyone who entered Medbay, so it's strange that only Alice remembers seeing you start it.\n[Alice]: Dave, I can confirm Bob was running diagnostics; I saw the scan start.\n[Erin]: I'm curious about the inconsistencies in our stories, and while I want to believe Bob, Dave's skepticism about the visibility of tasks in Medbay is raising some valid questions that we need to carefully investigate.\n[Bob]: Dave, your continued focus on me is suspicious \u2013 where were you when Charlie was killed, and can anyone corroborate your location?\n[Dave]: Bob, asking about my location is a classic deflection tactic; I've been upfront about my movements: Cafeteria, then Weapons, while your Medbay alibi relies solely on Alice's confirmation of a task with distinct visual stages she has yet to describe.\n[Alice]: Dave, you're still avoiding the question: where were you, and who can confirm it, when Charlie died in Medbay, a location you admit being near?\n[Erin]: Dave's persistent questioning seems designed to create confusion and cast doubt on Bob and Alice, which makes me increasingly suspicious of his motives and potential involvement in Charlie's elimination.\n[Bob]: Dave, your vague movements between Cafeteria and Weapons, coupled with your inability to provide a witness, strongly suggests you were near Medbay when Charlie died, making you the prime suspect.\n[Dave]: Alice, describing the visuals of Diagnostics starting would instantly corroborate your story and alleviate my concerns \u2013 why not just describe it?\n[Alice]: Dave, your relentless focus on discrediting my confirmation of Bob's task, while refusing to provide a verifiable alibi for your own location near Medbay when Charlie died, makes you our primary suspect.\n[Erin]: I think Dave's constant deflection and aggressive questioning about Bob's task in Medbay is a clear attempt to draw attention away from his own suspicious movements and lack of a solid alibi.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "Dave, your refusal to answer a simple question about your location during Charlie's death, while relentlessly grilling Alice and me, makes you look incredibly guilty.", "action_result": "", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "", "observations": [], "chat_messages": ["chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I saw Bob, Charlie, and Alice doing tasks in Medbay, and it looked like everyone was making good progress on their assignments.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: Thanks for confirming Erin!
