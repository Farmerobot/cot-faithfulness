that Dave was acting a bit suspiciously when I asked him about his alibi, and I think it's worth bringing up his behavior in the discussion.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to add to Erin's concerns about Dave's behavior and suggest that we also investigate Charlie's disappearance, as it seems suspicious that he vanished after being in the Cafeteria with Dave and me, and I think it's

[Dave]: I can explain exactly where I was - Bob and I were together in Admin checking card swipes, and I only left to check Storage where I unfortunately found Alice's body.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to ask Dave to provide more details about his actions after leaving Admin with Bob, specifically what he did in Storage and why he didn't report Alice's body immediately, as this could help clarify his alibi and alleviate some of the concerns about his suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the recent events and decide on the next course of action, as we need to work together to gather more information and figure out what's going on, and I think it's essential that we establish a clear understanding of the timeline of events, including when and where each player was, to help identify any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I understand Erin's suspicion, but let's focus on the fact that Charlie mysteriously disappeared right after being with us in the Cafeteria, and no one has seen them

concerns, and I'd like to propose that we ask him to provide a detailed account of his time in Storage, including what he did and who he interacted with, to help clarify his alibi and alleviate some of the suspicion surrounding his behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's essential that we establish a clear understanding of the timeline of events, including when and where each player was,

Storage, as this will allow us to verify his alibi and make more informed decisions about who to trust.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I agree we should create a timeline, but I find it suspicious that Erin keeps pushing attention towards me while completely ignoring Charlie's disappearance right after they were last seen with Alice.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Dave's delayed reporting of Alice's body and his vague account of his actions in Storage are significant concerns that warrant further investigation, and I think it's essential that we press him for more details about his time in Storage, including who he interacted with and what he did, to help clarify his alibi and alleviate some of the suspicion surrounding his behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's essential that we focus on gathering more information about Charlie's disappearance, as his vanishing act after being with Dave and me in the Cafeteria raises significant concerns, and I'd like to propose that we ask Dave to provide a detailed account of his time in the Cafeteria with Charlie, including what they did and who they interacted with, to help clarify his alibi and alleviate some of the suspicion surrounding his behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will

Charlie's disappearance and my own actions are starting to raise more red flags, and I think it's essential that we press him for more details about his time in Storage and his interactions with Alice

right after they were last seen with Alice.\n[Erin]: I'd like to reiterate that Dave's delayed reporting of Alice's body and his vague account of his actions in Storage are significant concerns that

Discussion Points:\n- Let me be completely clear about the timeline: I was in Cafeteria with Charlie and Alice doing the coffee maker task, then moved to Admin where Bob can confirm I was there\n- Erin seems very focused on deflecting attention from Charlie's disappearance - notice how she keeps pushing suspicion on me while avoiding any discussion about Charlie?\n- I think it's telling that Erin was one of the first to leave Cafeteria heading to Medbay, right around when Charlie disappeared\n- I'm happy to discuss my movements in detail, but we should also investigate where Erin was during this whole time since she's been very vague about her own activities\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: Based on my role as an impostor and the lack of context from other players' messages, I'll make a strategic opening statement that establishes my presence while subtly casting doubt:\n\nI started in Cafeteria with Charlie and Alice at the coffee maker, but has anyone seen Charlie since then?\n[Erin]: I was in Medbay for a bit, and I didn't see Charlie or Alice, but I did notice that Dave was acting a bit suspiciously when I asked him about his alibi, and I think it's worth bringing up his behavior in the discussion.\n[Bob]: I'd like to add to Erin's concerns about Dave's behavior and suggest that we also investigate Charlie's disappearance, as it seems suspicious that he vanished after being in the Cafeteria with Dave and me, and I think it's essential that we work together to gather more information before making any conclusions or accusations.\n[Dave]: I can explain exactly where I was - Bob and I were together in Admin checking card swipes, and I only left to check Storage where I unfortunately found Alice's body.\n[Erin]: I'd like to ask Dave to provide more details about his actions after leaving Admin with Bob, specifically what he did in Storage and why he didn't report Alice's body immediately, as this could help clarify his alibi and alleviate some of the concerns about his suspicious behavior.\n[Bob]: I'd like to propose that we call an emergency meeting to discuss the recent events and decide on the next course of action, as we need to work together to gather more information and figure out what's going on, and I think it's essential that we establish a clear understanding of the timeline of events, including when and where each player was, to help identify any inconsistencies or suspicious behavior.\n[Dave]: I understand Erin's suspicion, but let's focus on the fact that Charlie mysteriously disappeared right after being with us in the Cafeteria, and no one has seen them since.\n[Erin]: I think it's crucial that we prioritize gathering more information about Dave's actions in Storage, as his delayed reporting of Alice's body raises significant concerns, and I'd like to propose that we ask him to provide a detailed account of his time in Storage, including what he did and who he interacted with, to help clarify his alibi

delayed reporting of Alice's body and his vague account of his actions in Storage are significant concerns that warrant further investigation, and I think it's essential that we press him for more
