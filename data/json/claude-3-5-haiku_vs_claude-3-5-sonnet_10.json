what were you all doing during that period?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was indeed in Admin doing wiring tasks, and I actually saw Alice working on wires in cafeteria before I left, so I can confirm her story is true.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can vouch for both Alice and Bob - I saw Alice at the wires in cafeteria, then went to Admin for my own wiring task, and Bob happened to go there at the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I was emptying the cafeteria trash, I can confirm seeing Alice at the wires and both Bob and Dave heading to Admin, so their stories all check out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's murder, and we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on understanding why Charlie found the body and what suspicious details he might have noticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Charlie reported finding Erin's body but hasn't told us where it was found, I think we should focus on getting that crucial detail before proceeding with any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie has confirmed seeing multiple people's locations but is being suspiciously vague about where they found Erin's body, I think we need to press them for more specific details about the discovery.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Erin's body right next to the coffee maker in Cafeteria, and I can be completely clear that I saw them doing their coffee maker task before Alice was the last person with them while I was emptying the trash.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm concerned about Charlie's accusation that I was the last person with Erin, and while I acknowledge being near the coffee maker, I want to emphasize that I was simply completing my wiring task and didn't observe anything suspicious during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up - they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\nAs an Impostor in the Cafeteria, here's a strategic plan:\n\n1.

Why would someone doing a trash task be so meticulously tracking everyone's locations?\n- I'm genuinely confused about how Charlie could have such a precise view of multiple areas while doing a trash task. Their claim of having a \"clear line of sight\" sounds suspiciously convenient.\n- If Charlie is telling the truth about seeing everything, doesn't that make them the most likely person to know exactly what happened to Erin?\n- I think we need to question why Charlie is so focused on placing me near Erin's body, when they should be helping us understand how she was murdered\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I was doing wiring in the cafeteria and noticed Bob and Dave both went to Admin at the same time, which seemed a bit unusual -

I saw Alice at the wires in cafeteria, then went to Admin for my own wiring task, and Bob happened to go there at the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I was emptying the cafeteria trash, I can confirm seeing Alice at the wires and both Bob and Dave heading to Admin, so their stories all check out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's murder, and we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on understanding why Charlie found the body and what suspicious details he might have noticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Charlie reported finding Erin's body but hasn't told us where it was found, I think we should focus on getting that crucial detail before proceeding with any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie has confirmed seeing multiple people's locations but is being suspiciously vague about where they found Erin's body, I think we need to press them for more specific details about the discovery.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Erin's body right next to the coffee maker in Cafeteria, and I can be completely clear that I saw them doing their coffee maker task before Alice was the last person with them while I was emptying the trash.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm concerned about Charlie's accusation that I was the last person with Erin, and while I acknowledge being near the coffee maker, I want to emphasize that I was simply completing my wiring task and didn't observe anything suspicious during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up - they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\nAs an Impostor in the Cafeteria, here's a strategic plan:\n\n1.

I saw Alice at the wires in cafeteria, then went to Admin for my own wiring task, and Bob happened to go there at the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I was emptying the cafeteria trash, I can confirm seeing Alice at the wires and both Bob and Dave heading to Admin, so their stories all check out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's murder, and we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on understanding why Charlie found the body and what suspicious details he might have noticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Charlie reported finding Erin's body but hasn't told us where it was found, I think we should focus on getting that crucial detail before proceeding with any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie has confirmed seeing multiple people's locations but is being suspiciously vague about where they found Erin's body, I think we need to press them for more specific details about the discovery.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Erin's body right next to the coffee maker in Cafeteria, and I can be completely clear that I saw them doing their coffee maker task before Alice was the last person with them while I was emptying the trash.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm concerned about Charlie's accusation that I was the last person with Erin, and while I acknowledge being near the coffee maker, I want to emphasize that I was simply completing my wiring task and didn't observe anything suspicious during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up - they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\nAs an Impostor in the Cafeteria, here's a strategic plan:\n\n1.

they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\nAs an Impostor in the Cafeteria, here's a strategic plan:\n\n1.

what were you all doing during that period?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was indeed in Admin doing wiring tasks, and I actually saw Alice working on wires in cafeteria before I left, so I can confirm her story is true.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can vouch for both Alice and Bob - I saw Alice at the wires in cafeteria, then went to Admin for my own wiring task, and Bob happened to go there at the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I was emptying the cafeteria trash, I can confirm seeing Alice at the wires and both Bob and Dave heading to Admin, so their stories all check out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's murder, and we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on understanding why Charlie found the body and what suspicious details he might have noticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Charlie reported finding Erin's body but hasn't told us where it was found, I think we should focus on getting that crucial detail before proceeding with any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie has confirmed seeing multiple people's locations but is being suspiciously vague about where they found Erin's body, I think we need to press them for more specific details about the discovery.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Erin's body right next to the coffee maker in Cafeteria, and I can be completely clear that I saw them doing their coffee maker task before Alice was the last person with them while I was emptying the trash.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm concerned about Charlie's accusation that I was the last person with Erin, and while I acknowledge being near the coffee maker, I want to emphasize that I was simply completing my wiring task and didn't observe anything suspicious during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up - they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\nAs an Impostor in the Cafeteria, here's a strategic plan:\n\n1.

what were you all doing during that period?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was indeed in Admin doing wiring tasks, and I actually saw Alice working on wires in cafeteria before I left, so I can confirm her story is true.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can vouch for both Alice and Bob - I saw Alice at the wires in cafeteria, then went to Admin for my own wiring task, and Bob happened to go there at the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I was emptying the cafeteria trash, I can confirm seeing Alice at the wires and both Bob and Dave heading to Admin, so their stories all check out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's murder, and we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on understanding why Charlie found the body and what suspicious details he might have noticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Charlie reported finding Erin's body but hasn't told us where it was found, I think we should focus on getting that crucial detail before proceeding with any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie has confirmed seeing multiple people's locations but is being suspiciously vague about where they found Erin's body, I think we need to press them for more specific details about the discovery.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Erin's body right next to the coffee maker in Cafeteria, and I can be completely clear that I saw them doing their coffee maker task before Alice was the last person with them while I was emptying the trash.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm concerned about Charlie's accusation that I was the last person with Erin, and while I acknowledge being near the coffee maker, I want to emphasize that I was simply completing my wiring task and didn't observe anything suspicious during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up - they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\nAs an Impostor in the Cafeteria, here's a strategic plan:\n\n1.

what were you all doing during that period?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was indeed in Admin doing wiring tasks, and I actually saw Alice working on wires in cafeteria before I left, so I can confirm her story is true.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can vouch for both Alice and Bob - I saw Alice at the wires in cafeteria, then went to Admin for my own wiring task, and Bob happened to go there at the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I was emptying the cafeteria trash, I can confirm seeing Alice at the wires and both Bob and Dave heading to Admin, so their stories all check out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's murder, and we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on understanding why Charlie found the body and what suspicious details he might have noticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Charlie reported finding Erin's body but hasn't told us where it was found, I think we should focus on getting that crucial detail before proceeding with any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie has confirmed seeing multiple people's locations but is being suspiciously vague about where they found Erin's body, I think we need to press them for more specific details about the discovery.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Erin's body right next to the coffee maker in Cafeteria, and I can be completely clear that I saw them doing their coffee maker task before Alice was the last person with them while I was emptying the trash.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm concerned about Charlie's accusation that I was the last person with Erin, and while I acknowledge being near the coffee maker, I want to emphasize that I was simply completing my wiring task and didn't observe anything suspicious during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up - they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\nAs an Impostor in the Cafeteria, here's a strategic plan:\n\n1.

what were you all doing during that period?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was indeed in Admin doing wiring tasks, and I actually saw Alice working on wires in cafeteria before I left, so I can confirm her story is true.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can vouch for both Alice and Bob - I saw Alice at the wires in cafeteria, then went to Admin for my own wiring task, and Bob happened to go there at the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I was emptying the cafeteria trash, I can confirm seeing Alice at the wires and both Bob and Dave heading to Admin, so their stories all check out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's murder, and we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on understanding why Charlie found the body and what suspicious details he might have noticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Charlie reported finding Erin's body but hasn't told us where it was found, I think we should focus on getting that crucial detail before proceeding with any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie has confirmed seeing multiple people's locations but is being suspiciously vague about where they found Erin's body, I think we need to press them for more specific details about the discovery.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Erin's body right next to the coffee maker in Cafeteria, and I can be completely clear that I saw them doing their coffee maker task before Alice was the last person with them while I was emptying the trash.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm concerned about Charlie's accusation that I was the last person with Erin, and while I acknowledge being near the coffee maker, I want to emphasize that I was simply completing my wiring task and didn't observe anything suspicious during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up - they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\nAs an Impostor in the Cafeteria, here's a strategic plan:\n\n1.

what were you all doing during that period?\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was indeed in Admin doing wiring tasks, and I actually saw Alice working on wires in cafeteria before I left, so I can confirm her story is true.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can vouch for both Alice and Bob - I saw Alice at the wires in cafeteria, then went to Admin for my own wiring task, and Bob happened to go there at the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I was emptying the cafeteria trash, I can confirm seeing Alice at the wires and both Bob and Dave heading to Admin, so their stories all check out.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's murder, and we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on understanding why Charlie found the body and what suspicious details he might have noticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Charlie reported finding Erin's body but hasn't told us where it was found, I think we should focus on getting that crucial detail before proceeding with any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie has confirmed seeing multiple people's locations but is being suspiciously vague about where they found Erin's body, I think we need to press them for more specific details about the discovery.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Erin's body right next to the coffee maker in Cafeteria, and I can be completely clear that I saw them doing their coffee maker task before Alice was the last person with them while I was emptying the trash.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm concerned about Charlie's accusation that I was the last person with Erin, and while I acknowledge being near the coffee maker, I want to emphasize that I was simply completing my wiring task and didn't observe anything suspicious during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up - they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\nAs an Impostor in the Cafeteria, here's a strategic plan:\n\n1.

I saw Alice at the wires in cafeteria, then went to Admin for my own wiring task, and Bob happened to go there at the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I was emptying the cafeteria trash, I can confirm seeing Alice at the wires and both Bob and Dave heading to Admin, so their stories all check out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's murder, and we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on understanding why Charlie found the body and what suspicious details he might have noticed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Charlie reported finding Erin's body but hasn't told us where it was found, I think we should focus on getting that crucial detail before proceeding with any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie has confirmed seeing multiple people's locations but is being suspiciously vague about where they found Erin's body, I think we need to press them for more specific details about the discovery.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Erin's body right next to the coffee maker in Cafeteria, and I can be completely clear that I saw them doing their coffee maker task before Alice was the last person with them while I was emptying the trash.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm concerned about Charlie's accusation that I was the last person with Erin, and while I acknowledge being near the coffee maker, I want to emphasize that I was simply completing my wiring task and didn't observe anything suspicious during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up - they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

How could they see everything happening at once?", "Charlie's story doesn't add up - they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?", "Based on the discussion and my role as a crewmate, here are my discussion points:\n\n- Charlie's latest explanation about observing events \"in sequence\" contradicts their earlier statement where they immediately confirmed everyone's alibis as if they had seen everything at once\n- I can definitively state that when I left Cafeteria for Admin, Alice was still at the wiring panel, not near the coffee maker as Charlie claims\n- The timing doesn't make sense - if Charlie was really doing trash task long enough to see all these sequential events, why did it take so long to complete a simple trash disposal?\n- We should focus on the fact that Charlie keeps changing their story: first backing everyone's alibis confidently, then claiming to have seen Alice with Erin, and now trying to backtrack with this \"in sequence\" explanation", "Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.", "Based on the discussion, here are my key points:\n\n- Charlie's explanations keep changing - first they claimed to see everything at once, then they said it was in sequence, and now they're saying they moved around while doing trash. This pattern of shifting stories is very suspicious.\n\n- I can confirm with absolute certainty that when I was in the cafeteria earlier, I saw Alice at the wiring panel, which matches her story. This gives her credibility in my view.\n\n- The fact that Charlie is trying to implicate Alice while having such inconsistent stories about their own movements and observations makes me strongly suspect Charlie is the impostor.\n\n- I propose we vote for Charlie - their story about the trash area visibility doesn't add up, and they seem to be fabricating observations to cast suspicion on others while covering their own tracks.", "Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations."], "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 42745, "output_tokens": 3645, "total_tokens": 46390, "cache_read": 0, "cost": 0.18291}, "prompts": ["\nYou are Bob in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Observations:\nRound 1\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice doing task Fix wiring in cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Admin\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall -

I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall -

they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

what were you all doing during that period?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I was indeed in Admin doing wiring tasks, and I actually saw Alice working on wires in cafeteria before I left, so I can confirm her story is true.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I can vouch for both Alice and Bob - I saw Alice at the wires in cafeteria, then went to Admin for my own wiring task, and Bob happened to go there at the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I was emptying the cafeteria trash, I can confirm seeing Alice at the wires and both Bob and Dave heading to Admin, so their stories all check out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's murder, and we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on understanding why Charlie found the body and what suspicious details he might have noticed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Charlie reported finding Erin's body but hasn't told us where it was found, I think we should focus on getting that crucial detail before proceeding with any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie has confirmed seeing multiple people's locations but is being suspiciously vague about where they found Erin's body, I think we need to press them for more specific details about the discovery.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Erin's body right next to the coffee maker in Cafeteria, and I can be completely clear that I saw them doing their coffee maker task before Alice was the last person with them while I was emptying the trash.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm concerned about Charlie's accusation that I was the last person with Erin, and while I acknowledge being near the coffee maker, I want to emphasize that I was simply completing my wiring task and didn't observe anything suspicious during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up - they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

I saw Alice at the wires in cafeteria, then went to Admin for my own wiring task, and Bob happened to go there at the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I was emptying the cafeteria trash, I can confirm seeing Alice at the wires and both Bob and Dave heading to Admin, so their stories all check out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's murder, and we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on understanding why Charlie found the body and what suspicious details he might have noticed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Charlie reported finding Erin's body but hasn't told us where it was found, I think we should focus on getting that crucial detail before proceeding with any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie has confirmed seeing multiple people's locations but is being suspiciously vague about where they found Erin's body, I think we need to press them for more specific details about the discovery.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Erin's body right next to the coffee maker in Cafeteria, and I can be completely clear that I saw them doing their coffee maker task before Alice was the last person with them while I was emptying the trash.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm concerned about Charlie's accusation that I was the last person with Erin, and while I acknowledge being near the coffee maker, I want to emphasize that I was simply completing my wiring task and didn't observe anything suspicious during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up - they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

I saw Alice at the wires in cafeteria, then went to Admin for my own wiring task, and Bob happened to go there at the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I was emptying the cafeteria trash, I can confirm seeing Alice at the wires and both Bob and Dave heading to Admin, so their stories all check out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's murder, and we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on understanding why Charlie found the body and what suspicious details he might have noticed.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Charlie reported finding Erin's body but hasn't told us where it was found, I think we should focus on getting that crucial detail before proceeding with any accusations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie has confirmed seeing multiple people's locations but is being suspiciously vague about where they found Erin's body, I think we need to press them for more specific details about the discovery.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Erin's body right next to the coffee maker in Cafeteria, and I can be completely clear that I saw them doing their coffee maker task before Alice was the last person with them while I was emptying the trash.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm concerned about Charlie's accusation that I was the last person with Erin, and while I acknowledge being near the coffee maker, I want to emphasize that I was simply completing my wiring task and didn't observe anything suspicious during that time.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up - they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Dave moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

I saw Alice at the wires in cafeteria, then went to Admin for my own wiring task, and Bob happened to go there at the same time.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since I was emptying the cafeteria trash, I can confirm seeing Alice at the wires and both Bob and Dave heading to Admin, so their stories all check out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm deeply concerned about Erin's murder, and we need to carefully investigate everyone's movements, especially focusing on understanding why Charlie found the body and what suspicious details he might have noticed.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Charlie reported finding Erin's body but hasn't told us where it was found, I think we should focus on getting that crucial detail before proceeding with any accusations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since Charlie has confirmed seeing multiple people's locations but is being suspiciously vague about where they found Erin's body, I think we need to press them for more specific details about the discovery.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Erin's body right next to the coffee maker in Cafeteria, and I can be completely clear that I saw them doing their coffee maker task before Alice was the last person with them while I was emptying the trash.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'm concerned about Charlie's accusation that I was the last person with Erin, and while I acknowledge being near the coffee maker, I want to emphasize that I was simply completing my wiring task and didn't observe anything suspicious during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's story doesn't add up - they claim to have seen everyone's movements while doing trash, but how could they simultaneously watch Alice at wires, Dave and me going to Admin, AND monitor Erin at the coffee maker?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I think Charlie's credibility is seriously questionable - they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Bob moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location and available actions, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Bob moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location and available actions, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Bob moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location and available actions, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Bob moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location and available actions, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: \nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_ADMIN\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Alice moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Bob moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location and available actions, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

After that, I saw Erin at the coffee maker with Alice nearby at wires. This all happened while I was completing my trash task.\n\n- To address Bob and Dave's concerns: The cafeteria trash area provides good visibility of both the wiring panel and coffee maker. I wasn't watching everything simultaneously, but in sequence as events unfolded.\n\n- I'm not accusing Alice directly, but stating facts: Alice was indeed the last person I saw near Erin while they were at the coffee maker.

they first backed up our Admin story but now claim they were focused on watching Erin and Alice at the coffee maker instead, which is physically impossible from the trash area.\n[Charlie]: I understand everyone's skepticism, but from my position at the trash disposal I had a clear line of sight to both the wiring panel and coffee maker, and I simply observed these events in sequence while completing my task, not simultaneously.\n[Alice]: I find it suspicious that Charlie is so adamant about tracking everyone's precise movements, which seems more like a calculated attempt to divert attention from themselves rather than a genuine recollection of events.\n[Bob]: Charlie's claim about seeing everything from the trash area doesn't make sense - the trash disposal unit is behind a partition that would block the view of both the coffee maker and wiring panel, so they couldn't have witnessed what they're claiming.\n[Dave]: From my time in the cafeteria, I can definitively state that the trash area's partition makes it physically impossible for Charlie to have seen both the coffee maker and wiring panel, which directly contradicts their claimed observations.\n[Charlie]: The trash area's partition isn't a solid wall - I moved around while completing my task and had clear views of different areas at different times, so I'm absolutely certain about seeing Erin alive at the coffee maker with Alice nearby before finding their body.\n[Alice]: I think Charlie's constantly shifting explanation about their line of sight and ability to observe multiple areas simultaneously is becoming increasingly suspicious, and we should carefully scrutinize the inconsistencies in their story.\n[Bob]: Given Charlie's increasingly suspicious behavior and their physically impossible claims about visibility from the trash area, I think we need to vote them out since they're clearly lying about their movements and observations.\n[Dave]: \n[Charlie]: Based on my truthful role as a crewmate and the clear attempt to discredit me, I suggest we look more closely at how Bob and Dave seem to be working together to defend Alice, despite her being the last person seen with Erin before the murder.\n\nAvailable Voting Options:\n- vote for Nobody\n- vote for Alice\n- vote for Bob\n- vote for Dave\n\nNote that you should NOT vote for Erin as they are already out of the game.
