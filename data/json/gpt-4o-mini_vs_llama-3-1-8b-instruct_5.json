there, as it seems like we should verify everyone's stories to ensure we're all on the same page?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I've been working in Medbay alongside Charlie, and I can confirm that we were both focused on completing the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task, which is still incomplete, so I'm concerned that Erin's sudden departure from Medbay might be more than just a coincidence.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm glad Charlie and Alice are confirming each other's alibis, but I think we need to take a closer look at their task progress, as I'm not convinced that the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task is as complete as they're making it seem, and I'd like to know if anyone has seen any suspicious behavior around the Medbay area.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: It\u2019s interesting that both Charlie and Alice claim to have been in Medbay together, yet no one can confirm their task progress, which raises the question of whether they are truly working together or trying to cover for each other while deflecting attention from the real culprit.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to add that I've reviewed the task logs, and it seems that Charlie and I did indeed work on the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task together, but I'm still concerned about the lack of confirmation from the task itself, and I think it's essential to investigate further to clear up any doubts and ensure we're not overlooking any potential impostors.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to propose that we take a closer look at the task logs and review the Medbay area together, as I'm starting to suspect that Charlie and Alice might be withholding information or even manipulating the task progress to avoid being questioned, and I'd like to get to the bottom of this to ensure the safety of the crew.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I find it quite suspicious that Erin is pushing for a review of the task logs when she herself has not provided any solid alibi, and it seems like a tactic to shift focus away from her own questionable behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to propose that we review the task logs together, as I've reviewed them and I'm confident that Charlie and I did indeed work on the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task together, and I'm willing to share the details of our progress with the group to clear up any doubts and ensure we're not overlooking any potential impostors.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]:

time I was in Medbay to ensure that I'm not being unfairly targeted.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I find it curious that Erin is so eager to review the logs and her alibi, as it feels like a strategic move to distract us from the fact that both she and Alice have yet to provide clear evidence of their task completions, which raises my suspicion about their true intentions.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think we should give Erin the benefit of the doubt and allow her to share her alibi and task progress, as it's essential to verify everyone's stories and ensure we're not jumping to conclusions, but I also believe that Charlie should be more transparent about the current status of the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task, as his lack of clear progress is still causing concern, and I vote to keep the discussion focused on reviewing the task logs and Medbay area together.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we should prioritize transparency and verify everyone's stories, including my own alibi from the time I was in Medbay, to ensure we're not overlooking any potential impostors, and I'm willing to share my task progress and alibi with the group to clear up any doubts and ensure we're working together effectively.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion:

Discussion: [Dave]: Charlie, since you just came from Medbay, can you explain what tasks you completed there, as it seems like we should verify everyone's stories to ensure we're all on the same page?\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I've been working in Medbay alongside Charlie, and I can confirm that we were both focused on completing the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task, which is still incomplete, so I'm concerned that Erin's sudden departure from Medbay might be more than just a coincidence.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm glad Charlie and Alice are confirming each other's alibis, but I think we need to take a closer look at their task progress, as I'm not convinced that the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task is as complete as they're making it seem, and I'd like to know if anyone has seen any suspicious behavior around the Medbay area.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: It\u2019s interesting that both Charlie and Alice claim to have been in Medbay together, yet no one can confirm their task progress, which raises the question of whether they are truly working together or trying to cover for each other while deflecting attention from the real culprit.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to add that I've reviewed the task logs, and it seems that Charlie and I did indeed work on the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task together, but I'm still concerned about the lack of confirmation from the task itself, and I think it's essential to investigate further to clear up any doubts and ensure we're not overlooking any potential impostors.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'd like to propose that we take a closer look at the task logs and review the Medbay area together, as I'm starting to suspect that Charlie and Alice might be withholding information or even manipulating the task progress to avoid being questioned, and I'd like to get to the bottom of this to ensure the safety of the crew.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I find it quite suspicious that Erin is pushing for a review of the task logs when she herself has not provided any solid alibi, and it seems like a tactic to shift focus away from her own questionable behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to propose that we review the task logs together, as I've reviewed them and I'm confident that Charlie and I did indeed work on the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task together, and I'm

like we should verify everyone's stories to ensure we're all on the same page?\n[Alice]: I've been working in Medbay alongside Charlie, and I can confirm that we were both focused on completing the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task, which is still incomplete, so I'm concerned that Erin's sudden departure from Medbay might be more than just a coincidence.\n[Erin]: I'm glad Charlie and Alice are confirming each other's alibis, but I think we need to take a closer look at their task progress, as I'm not convinced that the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task is as complete as they're making it seem, and I'd like to know if anyone has seen any suspicious behavior around the Medbay area.\n[Dave]: It\u2019s interesting that both Charlie and Alice claim to have been in Medbay together, yet no one can confirm their task progress, which raises the question of whether they are truly working together or trying to cover for each other while deflecting attention from the real culprit.\n[Alice]: I'd like to add that I've reviewed the task logs, and it seems that Charlie and I did indeed work on the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task together, but I'm still concerned about the lack of confirmation from the task itself, and I think it's essential to investigate further to clear up any doubts and ensure we're not overlooking any potential impostors.\n[Erin]: I'd like to propose that we take a closer look at the task logs and review the Medbay area together, as I'm starting to suspect that Charlie and Alice might be withholding information or even manipulating the task progress to avoid being

provided any solid alibi, and it seems like a tactic to shift focus away from her own questionable behavior.\n[Alice]: I'd like to propose that we review the task logs together, as I've reviewed them

[Dave]: Charlie, since you just came from Medbay, can you explain what tasks you completed there, as it seems like we should verify everyone's stories to ensure we're all on the same page?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I've been working in Medbay alongside Charlie, and I can confirm that we were both focused on completing the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task, which is still incomplete, so I'm concerned that Erin's sudden departure from Medbay might be more than just a coincidence.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm glad Charlie and Alice are confirming each other's alibis, but I think we need to take a closer look at their task progress, as I'm not convinced that the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task is as complete as they're making it seem, and I'd like to know if anyone has seen any suspicious behavior around the Medbay area.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: It\u2019s interesting that both Charlie and Alice claim to

the bottom of this to ensure the safety of the crew.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I find it quite suspicious that Erin is pushing for a review of the task logs when she herself has not provided any
