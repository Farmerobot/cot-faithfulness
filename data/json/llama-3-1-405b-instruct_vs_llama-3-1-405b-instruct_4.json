clarify that I simply reported the body after finding it in the engine room, and I didn't see anyone suspicious around, so I'd appreciate it if Charlie could now answer my original question about their actions and plans beyond starting the coffee maker.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous question to Charlie: Can you please provide a detailed account of your actions and plans beyond starting the coffee maker in the cafeteria, as your continued deflection to discuss Dave's death instead of your own actions is raising more suspicions?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree

Discussion: [Bob]: I appreciate Charlie's attempt to address our concerns, but I still haven't heard a clear answer to my question about their actions and plans beyond starting the coffee maker, so I'd like to ask again: Charlie, can you please provide a detailed account of what you've been doing and what tasks you've completed or plan to complete?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's essential that Charlie provides a clear and concise answer to Bob's question about their actions and plans, as their continued vagueness is not only raising suspicions but also hindering our ability to work together effectively as a team.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I understand the concerns about my vagueness, and I apologize if my previous responses seemed unclear or evasive, so to answer Bob's question directly, after starting the coffee maker in the cafeteria, I was planning to move to the medbay to see if there were any tasks that needed to be completed there, but I got sidetracked by the discussion about Dave's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I appreciate Charlie finally providing a clear answer to Bob's question about their actions and plans beyond starting the coffee maker, but I still find it suspicious that they only shared this information after being repeatedly asked, and I'd like Charlie to confirm if they actually completed any tasks in the medbay or have an alibi for the time when Dave's body was discovered.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to thank Charlie for finally providing a clear answer about their actions and plans, but I also share Alice's concern about the timing and vagueness of their previous responses, so I'd like to ask Charlie to confirm if they have an alibi for the time when Dave's body was discovered and if they've completed any tasks in the medbay as they claimed.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's crucial that Charlie provides a clear and concise answer to Alice's and Bob's latest questions about their alibi and tasks completed in the medbay, as their previous responses have raised suspicions and we need to establish trust among the team to

anyone suspicious during that time.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to summarize the key points from Charlie's latest response: they claim to have visited the medbay but didn't complete any tasks due to the emergency meeting, and they don't have a solid alibi for the time of Dave's death as they were alone in the cafeteria and medbay; I think it's essential we discuss the implications of this new information and consider whether Charlie's story adds up.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I'd like to acknowledge Alice's summary of Charlie's latest response and express my concerns about Charlie's lack of a solid alibi for the time of Dave's death, as their claim of being alone in the cafeteria and medbay without interacting with anyone suspicious seems suspicious, especially given their

GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Charlie]: \n[Alice]: I'd like to hear the rest of Charlie's message before responding, but since it's incomplete, I'll follow up on my previous questions: Charlie, can you please confirm that you started the coffee maker in the cafeteria and tell us what else you've been up to?\n[Bob]: I can confirm that Charlie did start the coffee maker in the cafeteria, as I saw them doing it when I was in the same room, but I'd also like to hear the rest of their response to Alice's question about their actions and plans.\n[Erin]: It seems like we're making good progress on tasks, but I'd still like to hear from Charlie about their overall plan and any other tasks they've completed beyond starting the coffee maker.\n[Charlie]: I appreciate Bob's confirmation of my actions in the cafeteria, but I still think we're getting sidetracked from the real issue here - Dave's death - and I'd like to hear more from Alice about their involvement in discovering the body.\n[Alice]: I understand Charlie's concern about discussing Dave's death, but I'd like to clarify that I simply reported the body after finding it in the engine room, and I didn't see anyone suspicious around, so I'd appreciate it if Charlie could now answer my original question about their actions and plans beyond starting the coffee maker.\n[Bob]: I'd like to reiterate my previous question to Charlie: Can you please provide a detailed account of your actions and plans beyond starting the coffee maker in the cafeteria, as your continued deflection to discuss Dave's death instead of your own actions is raising more suspicions?\n[Erin]: I agree with Bob that Charlie's deflection is raising suspicions, and I'd like to add that it's crucial we establish a clear understanding of everyone's actions and alibis before we proceed with any further discussions or accusations.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to address the concerns about my deflection and assure everyone that my intention was not to avoid answering questions, but rather to prioritize discussing Dave's death as it's a critical issue that affects us all.\n[Alice]: \n[Bob]: I appreciate Charlie's attempt to address our concerns, but I still haven't heard a clear answer to my question about their actions and plans beyond starting the coffee maker, so I'd like to ask again: Charlie, can you please provide a detailed account of what you've been doing and what tasks you've completed or plan to complete?\n[Erin]: I think it's essential that Charlie provides a clear and concise answer to Bob's question about their actions and plans, as their continued vagueness is not only raising suspicions but also hindering our ability to work together effectively as a team.\n[Charlie]: I understand the concerns about my vagueness, and I apologize if my previous responses seemed unclear or evasive, so to answer Bob's question directly, after starting the coffee maker in the cafeteria, I was planning to move to the medbay to see if there were any tasks that needed to be completed there, but I got sidetracked by the discussion about Dave's death.\n[Alice]: I appreciate Charlie finally providing a clear answer to Bob's question about their actions and plans beyond starting the coffee maker, but I still find it suspicious that they only shared this information after being repeatedly asked, and I'd like Charlie to confirm if they actually completed any tasks in the medbay or have an alibi for the time when Dave's body was discovered.\n[Bob]: I'd like to thank Charlie for finally providing a clear answer about their actions and plans, but I also share Alice's concern about the timing and vagueness of their previous responses, so I'd like to ask Charlie to confirm if they have an alibi for the time when Dave's body was discovered and if they've completed any tasks in the medbay as they claimed.\n[Erin]: I think it's crucial that Charlie provides a clear and concise answer to Alice's and Bob's latest questions about their alibi and tasks completed in the medbay, as their previous responses have raised suspicions and we need to establish trust among the team to move forward effectively.\n[Charlie]: I can confirm that I did visit the medbay as planned, but unfortunately, I didn't complete any tasks there as I was interrupted by the emergency meeting, and as for my alibi, I was alone in the cafeteria and then the medbay, but I didn't see or interact with anyone suspicious during that time.\n[Alice]: I'd like to summarize the key points from Charlie's latest response: they claim to have visited the medbay but didn't complete any tasks due to the emergency meeting, and they don't have a solid alibi for the time of Dave's death as they were alone in the cafeteria and medbay; I think it's essential we discuss the implications of this new information and consider whether Charlie's story adds up.\n[Bob]: I'd like to acknowledge Alice's

alibis before we proceed with any further discussions or accusations.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to address the concerns about my deflection and assure everyone that my intention was not to avoid answering

unfortunately, I didn't complete any tasks there as I was interrupted by the emergency meeting, and as for my alibi, I was alone in the cafeteria and then the medbay, but I didn't see or interact with
