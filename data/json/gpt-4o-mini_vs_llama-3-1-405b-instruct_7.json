Plan your next move based on their actions.\n\n4. **Prepare to eliminate** - As soon as an opportunity arises (e.g., a crewmate is alone and within striking distance), be ready to eliminate them when it is safe to do so and then either report the body or continue pretending to act innocent.", "pretend doing task: fix wiring in cafeteria", "1. **Continue pretending to do the task: Fix wiring in cafeteria** - Keep blending in with Alice and Dave while maintaining your cover.

Look for any signs of suspicion or if they begin to stray from each other.\n\n3. **Prepare to eliminate a target** - Based on the observations, if you notice that Alice or Dave becomes vulnerable (such as one moving away from the group or getting distracted), be ready to eliminate that player.\n\n4. **Choose to eliminate Alice or Dave** - When the opportunity presents itself and it's safe to act, eliminate the chosen target (Alice or Dave) and then either report the body or feign innocence by continuing to act as if you're busy with tasks.", "pretend doing task: fix wiring in cafeteria", "1. **Eliminate a crewmate** - Now that you are alone in the Cafeteria, take the opportunity to eliminate Alice or Dave as they are likely far away in Admin or Medbay, respectively. This is the perfect chance to make your move.\n\n2. **Report the body** - After eliminating Alice (or Dave), immediately report the body to create suspicion around other players regarding the incident. This will also establish an alibi for you, as you will appear as someone discovering the body.\n\n3. **Engage in discussion** - During the Discussion Phase, share your observations and thoughts about other players to deflect suspicion from yourself. Try to point towards someone else as the impostor and establish your innocence.\n\n4. **Vote strategically** - When it comes time to vote, coordinate your vote against someone you have observed acting suspiciously or isolate another crewmate you can frame.

Look for any crewmates who may be alone or in a vulnerable position, allowing you to execute your plan effectively.\n\n4. **Prepare to Eliminate** - If the situation presents an opportunity (i.e., a crewmate is alone), be ready to eliminate them and then either report the body or continue pretending to act innocent.", "move to location medbay", "1. **Eliminate Dave** - Since you are in Medbay with only Dave present, this is a perfect opportunity to eliminate him without drawing suspicion from other players.\n\n2. **Report the Body** - After eliminating Dave, quickly report the body.

Monitor his interactions and look for a moment when he might be alone or out of line of sight.\n\n3. **Assess opportunities** - If Dave moves away from your position, consider your options. If he stays alone, plan to eliminate him while it\u2019s safe and consensually void a report if possible.\n\n4. **Prepare to eliminate** - If a suitable opportunity arises where you can eliminate Dave without being seen, do so quickly.

This will allow you to control the narrative during the discussion phase.\n\n3. **Convey innocence** - During the discussion, emphasize that you were in Medbay and mention preparations to do tasks or that others were near you, steering the focus away from your actions.\n\n4. **Monte Carlo** - After the meeting, stay observant and be ready to blend in while further assessing other players\u2019 movements and identifying your next target.", "eliminate bob", "1. **Report dead body of Bob** - Since you are in Medbay with Bob and he has been eliminated, report his body to create chaos and shift suspicion away from yourself.\n\n2. **Wait for discussion** - During the discussion phase, listen carefully to how the other players respond to the report. This will give you insight into who is suspicious of whom and provide opportunities for you to defend yourself effectively.\n\n3. **Deflect accusations** - If questioned, leverage your position as a \"concerned crewmate\" who found the body and express uncertainty about who the impostors might be.
