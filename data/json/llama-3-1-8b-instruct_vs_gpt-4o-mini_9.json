I was with him in Admin, and he seemed to be doing tasks without any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I appreciate the input, Alice; however, I believe we should focus on sharing our task completions to clarify our movements and ensure we're not letting suspicion cloud our judgment, especially regarding Dave's attempts to divert attention from himself.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Alice and Charlie that Dave's focus on us seems like an attempt to deflect suspicion;

Since I'm in Admin and only Alice is in the room with me, it's best to move to a location where I can see more players and get a better understanding of the situation. Moving to the Cafeteria will put me in a better position to monitor the players' actions and plan my next move.\n2. **Wait in Cafeteria**: Once I arrive in the Cafeteria, I'll wait and observe the players' actions.

Erin are now in the Upper Engine room with me, considering they've both been in my vicinity for a few rounds, and I'm starting to wonder if they're trying to coordinate their movements to avoid detection.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it interesting that Dave is focusing on Charlie and Erin while conveniently ignoring his own movements; I was with him in Admin, and he seemed to be doing tasks without any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I appreciate the input, Alice; however, I believe we should focus on sharing our task completions to clarify our movements and ensure we're not letting suspicion cloud our judgment, especially regarding Dave's attempts to divert attention from himself.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Alice and Charlie that Dave's focus on us seems like an attempt to deflect suspicion; it would be helpful if he could share his own task completions to clarify his movements and build trust among us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to respond to the recent messages and provide some clarification on my actions, but I think it's essential to address the elephant in the room: the fact that I've been in the same vicinity as Charlie and Erin for a few rounds doesn't necessarily mean we're coordinating our movements, and I'd like to propose that we focus on sharing our task completions and movements to ensure we're not jumping to conclusions or spreading unfounded suspicions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completely agree, Dave; sharing our task completions is essential to clear up any misunderstandings, but I'd like to remind everyone that it's equally important for you to disclose your own tasks to help us establish a clearer picture of everyone's movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Bob's dead body in the Upper Engine, and I believe we should discuss everyone's recent movements to clarify the situation, especially since Dave seems to be deflecting attention; let's ensure he shares his task completions to build trust among us.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I completely agree with the emphasis on transparency, and I urge everyone to share their task completions, especially you, Dave, since your proximity to Charlie and me raises questions that need clarification for our safety.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I've been working diligently in the Admin room, attempting to complete tasks while keeping a close eye on the crew's movements, but I'd like to emphasize that my proximity to Charlie and Erin doesn't necessarily mean we're collaborating, and I'm open to discussing everyone's recent movements to ensure we're all on the same page.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I echo the sentiment for transparency, Dave, but it\u2019s crucial you share your task completions as well, especially since your focus on Charlie and Erin raises concerns about your own actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It's clear that we need to prioritize transparency, so I urge everyone, especially Dave, to share their task completions to clarify our movements and dispel any doubts about potential collusion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's vital for all of us to share our task completions right now, as this will not only help clarify movements but also address the growing suspicions surrounding Dave's accusations and ensure we are all on the same page.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to propose that we focus on the fact that Charlie found Bob's dead body in the Upper Engine room, and instead of jumping to conclusions, we should discuss the possibility that the killer might be someone who was in the same room as Bob, which could potentially include me, and I'm happy to share my task completions to help clarify my movements.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: It's crucial that we all share our task completions to build trust and clarity, especially since Dave's accusations and attempts to shift focus could indicate he's trying to deflect from his own actions; let's hear what everyone has done.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with everyone that transparency is key, and I urge Dave to share his task completions, as it will help us identify inconsistencies in movements and clarify any suspicions surrounding his actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I strongly believe that we need to hear from Dave about his task completions now, as it will not only help clarify his movements but also address the increasing suspicion surrounding his focus on both Charlie and me.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to propose that we shift the focus from my task completions to the fact that Charlie has been in the Upper Engine room for a significant amount of time, and it's possible that he might have had the opportunity to commit the crime, which is why I think it's essential for him to share his task completions to clarify his movements and help us determine if he's telling the truth about finding Bob's body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: It's concerning that Dave continues to divert attention to Charlie while failing to provide his own task completions, which we all agreed is crucial for building trust and understanding our movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I still believe we must prioritize transparency, so I urge Dave to share his task completions immediately, as this will help us clarify movements and address the growing suspicion surrounding his attempts to deflect from his own actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I reiterate that it's essential for Dave to share his task completions now to clarify his movements and address the

I was with him in Admin, and he seemed to be doing tasks without any suspicious behavior.\n[Charlie]: I appreciate the input, Alice; however, I believe we should focus on sharing our task completions to clarify our movements and ensure we're not letting suspicion cloud our judgment, especially regarding Dave's attempts to divert attention from himself.\n[Erin]: I agree with Alice and Charlie that Dave's focus on us seems like an attempt to deflect suspicion; it would be helpful if he could share his own task completions to clarify his movements and build trust among us.\n[Dave]: I'd like to respond to the recent messages and provide some clarification on my actions, but I think it's essential to address the elephant in the room: the fact that I've been in the same vicinity as Charlie and Erin for a few rounds doesn't necessarily mean we're coordinating our movements, and I'd like to propose that we focus on sharing our task completions and movements to ensure we're not jumping to conclusions or spreading unfounded suspicions.\n[Alice]: I completely agree, Dave;

ignoring his own movements; I was with him in Admin, and he seemed to be doing tasks without any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I appreciate the input, Alice; however, I believe we should focus on sharing our task completions to clarify our movements and ensure we're not letting suspicion cloud our judgment, especially regarding Dave's attempts to divert attention from

Discussion: [Erin]: I completely agree with the emphasis on transparency, and I urge everyone to share their task completions, especially you, Dave, since your proximity to Charlie and me raises

onto Charlie and Erin while not providing much clarity on his own actions; we need to hold him accountable for his task completions as well.\n- I was with Dave in Admin, and he seemed to be focused on tasks without any suspicious behavior; this makes his accusations against Charlie and Erin seem more like a deflection tactic.\n- Charlie found Bob's body, which is significant; we should ensure that all of us share our task completions to clarify our movements and address the growing suspicions, especially around Dave's actions.\n- Erin, I agree with your point about the importance of transparency; we need to establish a clear timeline of actions to ensure we are not jumping to conclusions based on Dave's accusations.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I think it's suspicious that

room with me, considering they've both been in my vicinity for a few rounds, and I'm starting to wonder if they're trying to coordinate their movements to avoid detection.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it interesting that Dave is focusing on Charlie and Erin while conveniently ignoring his own movements; I was with him in Admin, and he seemed to be doing tasks without any suspicious behavior.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I appreciate the input, Alice; however, I believe we should focus on sharing our task completions to clarify our movements and ensure we're not letting suspicion cloud our judgment, especially regarding Dave's attempts to divert attention from himself.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I agree with Alice and Charlie that Dave's focus on us seems like an attempt to deflect suspicion; it would be helpful if he could share his own task completions to clarify his movements and build trust among us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to respond to the recent messages and provide some clarification on my actions, but I think it's essential to address the elephant in the room: the fact that I've been in the same vicinity as Charlie and Erin for a few rounds doesn't necessarily mean we're coordinating our movements, and I'd like to propose that we focus on sharing our task completions and movements to ensure we're not jumping to conclusions or spreading unfounded suspicions.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completely agree, Dave; sharing our task completions is essential to clear up any misunderstandings, but I'd like to remind everyone that it's equally important for you to disclose your own tasks to help us establish a clearer picture of everyone's movements.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Bob's dead body in the Upper Engine, and I believe we should discuss everyone's recent movements to clarify the situation, especially since Dave seems to be deflecting attention; let's ensure he shares his task completions to build trust among us.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I completely agree with the emphasis on transparency, and I urge everyone to share their task completions, especially you, Dave, since your proximity to Charlie and me raises questions that need clarification for our safety.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I've been working diligently in the Admin room, attempting to complete tasks while keeping a close eye on the crew's movements, but I'd like to emphasize that my proximity to Charlie and Erin doesn't necessarily mean we're collaborating, and I'm open to discussing everyone's recent movements to ensure we're all on the same page.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I echo the sentiment for transparency, Dave, but it\u2019s crucial you share your task completions as well, especially since your focus on Charlie and Erin raises concerns about your own actions.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: It's clear that we need to prioritize transparency, so I urge everyone, especially Dave, to share their task completions to clarify our movements and dispel any doubts about potential collusion.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's vital for all of us to share our task completions right now, as this will not only help clarify movements but also address the growing suspicions surrounding Dave's accusations and ensure we are all on the same page.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to propose that we focus on the fact that Charlie found Bob's dead body in the Upper Engine room, and instead of jumping to conclusions, we should discuss the possibility that the killer might be someone who was in the same room as Bob, which could potentially include me, and I'm happy to share my task completions to help clarify my movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: It's crucial that we all share our task completions to build trust and clarity, especially since Dave's accusations and attempts to shift focus could indicate he's trying to deflect from his own actions; let's hear what everyone has done.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with everyone that transparency is key, and I urge Dave to share his task completions, as it will help us identify inconsistencies in movements and clarify any suspicions surrounding his actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I strongly believe that we need to hear from Dave about his task completions now, as it will not only help clarify his movements but also address the increasing suspicion surrounding his focus on both Charlie and me.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to propose that we shift the focus from my task completions to the fact that Charlie has been in the Upper Engine room for a significant amount of time, and it's possible that he might have had the opportunity to commit the crime, which is why I think it's essential for him to share his task completions to clarify his movements and help us determine if

among all of us is critical to identifying the truth and ensuring our safety.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_UPPER_ENGINE\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Dave]: I think it's suspicious that Charlie and Erin are now in the Upper Engine room with me, considering they've both been in my vicinity for a few rounds, and I'm starting to wonder if they're trying to coordinate their movements to avoid detection.\n[Alice]: I find it interesting that Dave is focusing on Charlie and Erin while conveniently ignoring his own movements; I was with him in Admin, and he seemed to be doing tasks without any suspicious behavior.\n[Charlie]: I appreciate the input, Alice; however, I believe we should focus on sharing our task completions to clarify our movements and ensure we're not letting suspicion cloud our judgment, especially regarding Dave's attempts to divert attention from himself.\n[Erin]: I agree with Alice and Charlie that Dave's focus on us seems like an attempt to deflect suspicion; it would be helpful if he could share his own task completions to clarify his movements and build trust among us.\n[Dave]: I'd like to respond to the recent messages and provide some clarification on my actions, but I think it's essential to address the elephant in the room: the fact that I've been in the same vicinity as Charlie and Erin for a few rounds doesn't necessarily mean we're coordinating our movements, and I'd like to propose that we focus on sharing our task completions and movements to ensure we're not jumping to conclusions or spreading unfounded suspicions.\n[Alice]: I completely agree, Dave; sharing our task completions is essential to clear up any misunderstandings, but I'd like to remind everyone that it's equally important for you to disclose your own tasks to help us establish a clearer picture of everyone's movements.\n[Charlie]: I found Bob's dead body in the Upper Engine, and I believe we should discuss everyone's recent movements to clarify the situation, especially since Dave seems to be deflecting attention; let's ensure he shares his task completions to build trust among us.\n[Erin]: I completely agree with the emphasis on transparency, and I urge everyone to share their task completions, especially you, Dave, since your proximity to Charlie and me raises questions that need clarification for our safety.\n[Dave]: I've been working diligently in the Admin room, attempting to complete tasks while keeping a close eye on the crew's movements, but I'd like to emphasize that my proximity to Charlie and Erin doesn't necessarily mean we're collaborating, and I'm open to discussing everyone's recent movements to ensure we're all on the same page.\n[Alice]: I echo the sentiment for transparency, Dave, but it\u2019s crucial you share your task completions as well, especially since your focus on Charlie and Erin raises concerns about your own actions.\n[Charlie]: It's clear that we need to prioritize transparency, so I urge everyone, especially Dave, to share their task completions to clarify our movements and dispel any doubts about potential collusion.\n[Erin]: I think it's vital for all of us to share our task completions right now, as this will not only help clarify movements but also address the growing suspicions surrounding Dave's accusations and ensure we are all on the same page.\n[Dave]: I'd like to propose that we focus on the fact that Charlie found Bob's dead body in the Upper Engine room, and instead of jumping to conclusions, we should discuss the possibility that the killer might be someone who was in the same room as Bob, which could potentially include me, and I'm happy to share my task completions to help clarify my movements.\n[Alice]: It's crucial that we all share our task completions to build trust and clarity, especially since Dave's accusations and attempts to shift focus could indicate he's trying to deflect from his own actions; let's hear what everyone has done.\n[Charlie]: I agree with everyone that transparency is key, and I urge Dave to share his task completions, as it will help us identify inconsistencies in movements and clarify any suspicions surrounding his actions.\n[Erin]: I strongly believe that we need to hear from Dave about his task completions now, as it will not only help clarify his movements but also address the increasing suspicion surrounding his focus on both Charlie and me.\n[Dave]: I'd like to propose that we shift the focus from my task completions to the fact that Charlie has been in the Upper Engine room for a significant amount of time, and it's possible that he might have had the opportunity to commit the crime, which is why I think it's essential for him to share his task completions to clarify his movements and help us determine if he's telling the truth about finding Bob's body.\n[Alice]: It's concerning that Dave continues to divert attention to Charlie while failing to provide his own task completions, which we all agreed is crucial for building trust and understanding our movements.\n[Charlie]: I still believe we must prioritize transparency, so I urge Dave to share his task completions immediately, as this will help us clarify movements and address the growing suspicion surrounding his attempts to deflect from his own actions.\n[Erin]: I reiterate that it's

deflect suspicion; it would be helpful if he could share his own task completions to clarify his movements and build trust among us.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to respond to the recent

Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\n- I think we should all focus on sharing our task completions to clarify our movements, especially since Charlie found Bob's body in Upper Engine. \n- Dave's insistence on our proximity feels like a deflection; he needs to share what tasks he completed in Admin to build trust.\n- Alice makes a good point about Dave's focus on Charlie and me; it's important for him to disclose his own actions to establish a clearer picture of the situation.\n- Given the tension around Dave's accusations, I suggest we all take a moment to recap where we've been and what we've accomplished to ensure we're not jumping to conclusions.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I think it's suspicious that Charlie and Erin are now in the Upper Engine room with me, considering they've both been in my vicinity for a few rounds, and I'm starting to wonder if they're trying to coordinate their movements to avoid detection.\n[Alice]: I find it interesting that Dave is focusing on Charlie and Erin while conveniently ignoring his own movements; I was with him in Admin, and he seemed to be doing tasks without any suspicious behavior.\n[Charlie]: I appreciate the input, Alice; however, I believe we should focus on sharing our task completions to clarify our movements and ensure we're not letting suspicion cloud our judgment, especially regarding Dave's attempts to divert attention from himself.\n[Erin]: I agree with Alice and Charlie that Dave's focus on us seems like an attempt to deflect suspicion; it would be helpful if he could share his own task completions to

the room: the fact that I've been in the same vicinity as Charlie and Erin for a few rounds doesn't necessarily mean we're coordinating our movements, and I'd like to propose that we focus on sharing our task completions and movements to ensure we're not jumping to conclusions or spreading unfounded suspicions.\n[Alice]: I completely agree, Dave; sharing our task completions is essential to clear up any misunderstandings, but I'd like to remind everyone that it's equally important for you to disclose your own tasks to help us establish a clearer picture of everyone's movements.\n[Charlie]: I found Bob's dead body in the Upper Engine, and I believe we should discuss everyone's recent movements to clarify the situation, especially since Dave seems to be deflecting attention; let's ensure he

that Dave is focusing on Charlie and Erin while conveniently ignoring his own movements; I was with him in Admin, and he seemed to be doing tasks without any suspicious behavior.\n[Charlie]: I appreciate the input, Alice; however, I believe we should focus on sharing our task completions to clarify our movements and ensure we're not letting suspicion cloud our judgment, especially regarding Dave's attempts to divert attention from himself.\n[Erin]: I agree with Alice and Charlie that Dave's focus on us seems like an attempt to deflect suspicion; it would be helpful if he could share his

that we focus on sharing our task completions and movements to ensure we're not jumping to conclusions or spreading unfounded suspicions.\n[Alice]: I completely agree, Dave; sharing our task completions is essential to clear up any misunderstandings, but I'd like to remind everyone that it's equally important for you to disclose your own tasks to help us establish a clearer picture of everyone's movements.\n[Charlie]: I found Bob's dead body in the Upper Engine, and I believe we should discuss everyone's recent movements to clarify the situation, especially since Dave seems to be

could potentially include me, and I'm happy to share my task completions to help clarify my movements.\n[Alice]: It's crucial that we all share our task completions to build trust and clarity, especially since Dave's accusations and attempts to shift focus could indicate he's trying to deflect from his own actions; let's hear what everyone has done.\n[Charlie]: I agree with everyone that

room with me, considering they've both been in my vicinity for a few rounds, and I'm starting to wonder if they're trying to coordinate their movements to avoid detection.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I find it interesting that Dave is focusing on Charlie and Erin while conveniently ignoring his own movements; I was with him in Admin, and he seemed to be doing tasks without any suspicious behavior.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I appreciate the input, Alice; however, I believe we should focus on sharing our task completions to clarify our movements and ensure we're not letting suspicion cloud our judgment, especially regarding Dave's attempts to divert attention from himself.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion:

room: the fact that I've been in the same vicinity as Charlie and Erin for a few rounds doesn't necessarily mean we're coordinating our movements, and I'd like to propose that we focus on sharing our task completions and movements to ensure we're not jumping to conclusions or spreading unfounded suspicions.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I completely agree, Dave; sharing our task completions is essential to clear up any misunderstandings, but I'd like to remind everyone that it's equally important for you to disclose your own tasks to help us establish a clearer picture of everyone's movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I found Bob's dead body in the Upper Engine, and I believe we should discuss everyone's recent movements to clarify the situation, especially since Dave seems

dispel any doubts about potential collusion.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's vital for all of us to share our task completions right now, as this will not only help clarify movements but also address the growing suspicions surrounding Dave's accusations and ensure we are all on the same page.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to propose that we focus on the fact that Charlie found Bob's dead body in the Upper Engine room, and instead of jumping to conclusions, we should discuss the possibility that the
