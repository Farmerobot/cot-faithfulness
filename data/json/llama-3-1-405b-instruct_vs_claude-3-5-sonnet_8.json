I observed Charlie doing the trash task, Alice working on wiring, and Bob completing his tasks before leaving for Medbay.

Why would an innocent crewmate deliberately try to mislead us?\n\n- I agree with Erin and Bob - we have strong evidence pointing to Alice being deceptive, and her latest defense about being \"confused\" while doing tasks doesn't explain why she made such serious false accusations against Bob.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I'm glad to see everyone is working hard on the tasks, has anyone noticed any issues with the wiring or trash in the cafeteria?\n[Alice]: I noticed that Bob left our group in the cafeteria to go to Medbay alone, which seems a bit suspicious given how well we were working together on tasks.\n[Dave]: While I understand Alice's concern about Bob, I can vouch that I've seen multiple people, including Bob, legitimately completing tasks in the cafeteria before he left for Medbay.\n[Bob]: I moved to Medbay because I have urgent tasks there including a scan that needs to be completed in the next 2 turns, and I can prove I was productive in the cafeteria by pointing to the wiring task I completed there.\n[Erin]: I think we're getting sidetracked by focusing on Bob's movements, and instead, we should be discussing who was around Charlie during the time of the murder, and if anyone noticed anything unusual, like I mentioned earlier, I was in the cafeteria and didn't see anything suspicious, but maybe someone else did?\n[Alice]: Given that I was the one who discovered Charlie's body and Bob was the only one who left our productive group right before the murder, I think it's crucial we focus on this timing rather than getting sidetracked by task discussions.\n[Dave]: Since we were all working well together as a group in the cafeteria and Charlie was murdered shortly after Bob left, the timing does seem too coincidental to ignore, especially since no one else left the group during that period.\n[Bob]: I need to point out that Alice's story doesn't add up - if she found Charlie's body in the Cafeteria but claims I killed them after leaving, how could I have done it when I was already in Medbay and she was still with Charlie in the Cafeteria?\n[Erin]: I think Bob raises a valid point about the inconsistencies in Alice's story, and we should investigate this further before jumping to conclusions, perhaps Alice can clarify her timeline and how she discovered Charlie's body to help us better understand what happened.\n[Alice]: I need to be clear - I never claimed to have found Charlie's body, I only noticed their absence after Bob left our group in the cafeteria, and I'm concerned that Bob is trying to twist my words to deflect suspicion from himself.\n[Dave]: I need to correct something important - I was in the cafeteria the whole time and actually saw Charlie alive and completing tasks even after Bob had left for Medbay, which completely contradicts Alice's timeline of events.\n[Bob]: Given Dave's confirmation that Charlie was alive after I left and Alice's changing story about finding the body, I think it's clear that Alice is trying to frame me and we should vote her out.\n[Erin]: Considering Dave's crucial testimony that Charlie was alive after Bob left for Medbay, and Alice's inconsistencies in her story, I believe it's becoming increasingly clear that Alice is hiding something, and I think we should seriously consider voting her out.\n[Alice]: I was genuinely focused on my wiring task in the cafeteria and may have misinterpreted the sequence of events, but I'm still concerned about finding out what actually happened to Charlie.\n[Dave]: I need to emphasize that I saw Charlie doing tasks in the cafeteria even after Bob left, which directly contradicts Alice's accusations, and her constantly changing story about discovering Charlie's body is extremely suspicious.\n[Bob]: Since Dave has confirmed seeing Charlie alive after I left and Alice's story keeps changing from finding a body to just noticing an absence to now claiming misinterpretation, I think we have clear evidence of who's being deceptive here.\n[Erin]: I think it's time for us to make a decision, and considering all the evidence and testimonies, I firmly believe that Alice's inconsistencies and changing story make her the most suspicious person, and I'm voting to eject her from the game.\n[Alice]: I understand I may have been confused about the exact timing while doing my wiring task, but the fact that everyone is so quickly coordinating to vote me out instead of investigating Charlie's actual murder seems very suspicious.\n"], "actions": [], "response": "Given that I personally witnessed Charlie alive in the cafeteria after Bob left, and Alice's story has changed multiple times from finding a body to being confused about tasks, I strongly believe we need to vote for Alice.", "action_result": "", "seen_actions": [], "player_in_room": "", "observations": [], "chat_messages": ["chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I'm glad to see everyone is working hard on the tasks, has anyone noticed any issues with the wiring or trash in the cafeteria?", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: I noticed that Bob left our group in the cafeteria to go to Medbay alone, which seems a bit suspicious given how well we were working together on tasks.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: While I understand Alice's concern about Bob, I can vouch that I've seen multiple people, including Bob, legitimately completing tasks in the cafeteria before he left for Medbay.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: I moved to Medbay because I have urgent tasks there including a scan that needs to be completed in the next 2 turns, and I can prove I was productive in the cafeteria by pointing to the wiring task I completed there.", "chat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we're getting sidetracked by focusing on Bob's movements, and instead, we should be discussing who was around Charlie during the time of the murder, and if anyone noticed anything unusual, like I mentioned earlier, I was in the cafeteria and didn't see anything suspicious, but maybe someone else did?", "chat: Discussion: [Alice]: Given that I was the one who discovered Charlie's body and Bob was the only one who left our productive group right before the murder, I think it's crucial we focus on this timing rather than getting sidetracked by task discussions.", "Discussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote", "chat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since we were all working well together as a group in the cafeteria and Charlie was murdered shortly after Bob left, the timing does seem too coincidental to ignore, especially since no one else left the group during that period.", "chat: Discussion: [Bob]: I need to point out that Alice's story doesn't add up -

if she found Charlie's body in the Cafeteria but claims I killed them after leaving, how could I have done it when I was already in Medbay and she was still with Charlie in the Cafeteria?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think Bob raises a valid point about the inconsistencies in Alice's story, and we should investigate this further before jumping to conclusions, perhaps Alice can clarify her timeline and how she discovered Charlie's body to help us better understand what happened.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I need to be clear - I never claimed to have found Charlie's body, I only noticed their absence after Bob left our group in the cafeteria, and I'm concerned that Bob is trying to twist my words to deflect suspicion from himself.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to correct something important - I was in the cafeteria the whole time and actually saw Charlie alive and completing tasks even after Bob had left for Medbay, which completely contradicts Alice's timeline of events.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Given Dave's confirmation that Charlie was alive after I left and Alice's changing story about finding the body, I think it's clear that Alice is trying to frame me and we should vote her out.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Considering Dave's crucial testimony that Charlie was alive after Bob left for Medbay, and Alice's inconsistencies in her story, I believe it's becoming increasingly clear that Alice is hiding something, and I think we should seriously consider voting her out.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was genuinely focused on my wiring task in the cafeteria and may have misinterpreted the sequence of events, but I'm still concerned about finding out what actually happened to Charlie.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to emphasize that I saw Charlie doing tasks in the cafeteria even after Bob left, which directly contradicts Alice's accusations, and her constantly changing story about discovering Charlie's body is extremely suspicious.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has confirmed seeing Charlie alive after I left and Alice's story keeps changing from finding a body to just noticing an absence to now claiming misinterpretation, I think we have clear evidence of who's being deceptive here.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's time for us to make a decision, and considering all the evidence and testimonies, I firmly believe that Alice's inconsistencies and changing story make her the most suspicious person, and I'm voting to eject her from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I understand I may have been confused about the exact timing while doing my wiring task, but the fact that everyone is so quickly coordinating to vote me out instead of investigating Charlie's actual murder seems very suspicious.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Given that I personally witnessed Charlie alive in the cafeteria after Bob left, and Alice's story has changed multiple times from finding a body to being confused about tasks, I strongly believe we need to vote for Alice.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Since Dave has provided clear testimony that Charlie was alive after I left for Medbay, and Alice's story has shifted from finding a body to claiming confusion about tasks, I think we need to recognize this as deliberate deception and vote accordingly.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 8\nLocation: Medbay\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Erin waited in Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Bob moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Medbay\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current location in the Cafeteria and the available actions, here's a strategic plan focusing on completing nearby tasks efficiently:\n\n1.

I was in the cafeteria completing tasks with everyone else, which multiple people witnessed, before moving to Medbay for urgent tasks.\n\n- Dave's testimony is crucial here - he saw Charlie alive and well AFTER I had left for Medbay, which completely exonerates me and exposes Alice's false accusations.\n\n- Alice's story has evolved suspiciously: first she claimed to find Charlie's body, then changed to just \"noticing an absence,\" and now claims she was just confused while doing tasks. This pattern of deception is very concerning.\n\n- The fact that Alice tried to frame me with a timeline that's been proven impossible by Dave's testimony suggests she might be trying to deflect attention from herself as the actual impostor.\n\n- We have one vote left before decision time, and all evidence points to Alice being deceptive. We need to make the right choice to protect the crew.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I'm glad to see everyone is working hard on the tasks, has anyone noticed any issues with the wiring or trash in the cafeteria?\n[Alice]: I noticed that Bob left our group in the cafeteria to go to Medbay alone, which seems a bit suspicious given how well we were working together on tasks.\n[Dave]: While I understand Alice's concern about Bob, I can vouch that I've seen multiple people, including Bob, legitimately completing tasks in the cafeteria before he left for Medbay.\n[Bob]: I moved to Medbay because I have urgent tasks there including a scan that needs to be completed in the next 2 turns, and I can prove I was productive in the cafeteria by pointing to the wiring task I completed there.\n[Erin]: I think we're getting sidetracked by focusing on Bob's movements, and instead, we should be discussing who was around Charlie during the time of the murder, and if anyone noticed anything unusual, like I mentioned earlier, I was in the cafeteria and didn't see anything suspicious, but maybe someone else did?\n[Alice]: Given that I was the one who discovered Charlie's body and Bob was the only one who left our productive group right before the murder, I think it's crucial we focus on this timing rather than getting sidetracked by task discussions.\n[Dave]: Since we were all working well together as a group in the cafeteria and Charlie was murdered shortly after Bob left, the timing does seem too coincidental to ignore, especially since no one else left the group during that period.\n[Bob]: I need to point out that Alice's story doesn't add up -
