doing tasks together.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Given that I was in Cafeteria the whole time with everyone else, the killer must have struck in that brief moment when we started splitting up to head to different locations - I think we need to establish exactly when each person left and in what order.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since we were all doing tasks together and I stayed behind for

found Alice's body.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's story about our movements is completely false - I was in Cafeteria the entire time and saw him fabricating details about people leaving when we were all actually still there doing our tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to acknowledge my mistake - I was so focused on the coffee maker task that I clearly misunderstood the sequence of

there's some confusion about who left the cafeteria when, so let's focus on what we know for sure: we were all together initially, and then Alice was found dead.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given Dave's false story about our movements and his suspicious backtracking when caught in the lie, I believe he's the impostor who killed Alice while pretending to be focused on the coffee maker task.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's attempt to create a false narrative about people leaving the cafeteria when we were all clearly still there doing tasks makes him extremely suspicious, and I fully support ejecting him this round.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I understand I made a mistake about people leaving, but I was genuinely focused on the coffee maker task - you all saw me working on

- he first claimed to remember the exact order we left Cafeteria despite us never actually leaving, then tried to backtrack by saying he was too focused on the coffee maker to notice anything, which

Stay alert for other players while in Storage\n   (Since we wrongly ejected Dave and the real impostor is still out there, we need to be cautious but also try to find allies)\n\nRationale: This plan helps you make progress on your objectives while staying strategic about movement. Storage is a central location that will give you more options for your next moves, and completing tasks there will help the crew's overall progress. Since we now know the impostor is still among us (after Dave was wrongly ejected), we need to be extra careful but also try to regroup with trusted players like Charlie or Bob.", "move to location storage", "Based on your current location in Storage and the available actions, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

Move to Cafeteria\n   (This will put you in a better position to group up with other players, as it's a central meeting point)\n\nRationale: Since you're alone and we know there's an impostor active, it's smart to complete the available task in Admin quickly, then move towards more populated areas. The plan gets you back to central locations where you can potentially group up with other players for safety.

Wait for or try to regroup with other players\n   (Since Dave turned out to be innocent, there's still an impostor among the remaining players, making traveling alone risky)\n\nRationale: Your current tasks are in Upper Engine, Electrical, and Medbay, but you can't access those locations directly from Admin.

let's all head to navigation together next for the next set of tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we should pause our plans for navigation since I just discovered Alice's body in the Cafeteria - this must have happened right after we all split up from doing tasks together.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Given that I was in Cafeteria the whole time with everyone else, the killer must have struck in that brief moment when we started splitting up to head to different locations - I think we need to establish exactly when each person left and in what order.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: Since we were all doing tasks together and I stayed behind for the coffee maker, I think we need to focus on the exact moment when people started leaving - I distinctly remember Bob announcing Medbay first, then Erin following, while Charlie lingered a bit before leaving.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: It's strange that Dave remembers the order we left so clearly, wasn't he focused on the coffee maker?\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I need to firmly correct Dave's story - I never actually left the Cafeteria or followed Bob to Medbay, I stayed behind and that's exactly why I was the one who found Alice's body.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's story about our movements is completely false - I was in Cafeteria the entire time and saw him fabricating details about people leaving when we were all actually still there doing our tasks.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I need to acknowledge my mistake - I was so focused on the coffee maker task that I clearly misunderstood the sequence of events, but I'm certain we were all initially together doing tasks in Cafeteria.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: It seems like there's some confusion about who left the cafeteria when, so let's focus on what we know for sure: we were all together initially, and then Alice was found dead.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given Dave's false story about our movements and his suspicious backtracking when caught in the lie, I believe he's the impostor who killed Alice while pretending to be focused on the coffee maker task.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's attempt to create a false narrative about people leaving the cafeteria when we were all clearly still there doing tasks makes him extremely suspicious, and I fully support ejecting him this round.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I understand I made a mistake about people leaving, but I was genuinely focused on the coffee maker task - you all saw me working on it, and that's exactly why my recollection of movements was confused.\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: Erin and Charlie are right to question Dave's shifting narrative \u2013 it's highly suspicious, especially given his fabricated details about our movements.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: \"Dave's story has completely fallen apart - he first claimed to remember the exact order we left Cafeteria despite us never actually leaving, then tried to backtrack by saying he was too focused on the coffee maker to notice anything, which directly contradicts his earlier detailed account of our movements.\"\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Since Dave first gave a detailed but false account of our movements and then completely changed his story when called out, I think we have more than enough evidence to vote him out as the impostor who killed Alice while pretending to be distracted by the coffee maker.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I know the coffee maker task distracted me, but think about it - if I was the impostor, why would I be doing a real task instead of just faking it like impostors usually do?\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_CAFETERIA\nObservations:\n\nRound 7\nLocation: Weapons\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Bob moved to Medbay from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Erin doing task Fix wiring in cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYour previous plan:\nBased on the recent discussion and current game state, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1.

I can understand why this looks suspicious, but rushing to vote me out could cost us the game if I'm not the impostor.\n\n- Let's focus on what we know for certain: Everyone saw me actually completing the coffee maker task, which proves I was doing real crew work. An impostor would likely have just pretended.\n\n- I find it interesting that Erin claims she never left but also claims she \"discovered\" Alice's body. If she was there the whole time, wouldn't she have witnessed the murder instead of just finding the body?\n\n- Bob initially suggested going to Medbay and seemed eager to get people to leave the Cafeteria. While I made a mistake about who actually left, his rush to move locations seems worth discussing.\n\n- Rather than focusing solely on my admittedly confused recollection, we should consider who had the opportunity to kill Alice while everyone was focused on their tasks.
