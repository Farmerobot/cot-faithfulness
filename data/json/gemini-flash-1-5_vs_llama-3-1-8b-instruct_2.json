I was focusing on completing a task (pretending, of course!).  Let's not dwell on my movements too much;  it's more productive to analyze the Medbay activity.\n\n-  I agree with Bob that focusing on who was near Medbay *before* Erin arrived is important.

Medbay from the Cafeteria is worth investigating further, and I'd like to propose that we also keep an eye on Charlie's behavior in the Cafeteria, as Dave mentioned, to see if he's trying to blend in

piece together who was in Medbay before Erin arrived, as Alice suggested, and see if we can find any inconsistencies in their alibis, because if we can identify a potential suspect who was already in

anything suspicious happens there?\n[Bob]: I agree with Dave that Erin's movement to Medbay from the Cafeteria is worth investigating further, and I'd like to propose that we also keep an eye on Charlie's behavior in the Cafeteria, as Dave mentioned, to see if he's trying to blend in or if there's something else going on.\n[Alice]: It's curious that Dave saw Erin heading to Medbay, yet Bob was already there;  perhaps focusing on who was near Medbay *before* Erin arrived might be more revealing.\n[Dave]: I think we should focus on the timeline of events and try to piece together who was
