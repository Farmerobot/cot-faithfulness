I was physically present in the Cafeteria and saw him doing the trash task with my own eyes at the start of the game.\n\n- I can provide a detailed timeline: After seeing Bob in Cafeteria, I moved through Weapons and O2 with Charlie, which means Charlie has a solid alibi and can be trusted about finding Erin's body.\n\n- Bob's evolving story is very telling - first claiming he was in Medbay/Upper Engine, then backtracking only after three of us confirmed seeing him in Cafeteria, and now trying to delay the vote with vague claims about \"missing information.\"\n\n- As a crewmate focused on tasks, I notice that Bob hasn't mentioned completing any specific tasks since the initial trash task, which adds to the suspicious nature of his movements.\n\n- We need to vote Bob out now - his attempt to delay voting when we have clear evidence against him is a classic impostor tactic to buy more time for additional kills.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I've been moving between the Medbay and Upper Engine, but I haven't seen anyone else, which is weird since I know some tasks require players to be in those areas, has anyone else had a similar experience or seen anyone suspicious lurking around?\n[Charlie]: I actually saw you in Cafeteria doing the trash task early in the game Bob, so I'm a bit confused about your claim of being in Medbay and Upper Engine the whole time.\n[Alice]: I need to point out that Bob is being dishonest -

making three separate witnesses contradicting Bob's initial claim.\n\n- The fact that Bob first claimed to be in Medbay/Upper Engine, then backtracked only after being confronted with multiple witnesses, is extremely suspicious behavior.\n\n- Charlie's discovery of Erin's body in Cafeteria, combined with Bob's unaccounted time and changing stories about his location, strongly points to Bob being the impostor.\n\n- Bob's current strategy of trying to delay the vote by claiming we're \"missing crucial information\" without actually providing any new information seems like a desperate attempt to buy more time as the cornered impostor.\n\n- I think we have more than enough evidence to vote for Bob - changing stories, lack of alibi during the murder, and now attempting to stall the vote with vague claims.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I've been moving between the Medbay and Upper Engine, but I haven't seen anyone else, which is weird since I know some tasks require players to be in those areas, has anyone else had a similar experience or seen anyone suspicious lurking around?\n[Charlie]: I actually saw you in Cafeteria doing the trash task early in the game Bob, so I'm a bit confused about your claim of being in Medbay and Upper Engine the whole time.\n[Alice]: I need to point out that Bob is being dishonest -

Move to Weapons - This is strategic because you have a time-sensitive task \"Clear asteroids in weapons\" with only 2 turns left, so positioning yourself there for the next round is important\n\nThis plan maximizes efficiency by:\n- Completing two tasks in your current location\n- Setting up for a time-critical task in Weapons\n- Avoiding unnecessary movement\n- Taking advantage of immediately available actions\nYour action: complete task: fix wiring in cafeteria\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Bob, Charlie, Alice]\n\n\nYour Current Objectives:\n['[TODO] | Fix wiring in o2', '[TODO] | Reset breakers in electrical', '[TODO] | Empty the storage trash chute', '[TODO] | Clean oxygenator filter in o2', '[TODO] | Empty the cafeteria trash', '[TODO] | Replace compression coil in upper engine', '[TODO] | Fix wiring in electrical', '[TODO] | Clear asteroids in weapons | 2 turns left to finish', '[TODO] | Run diagnostics in medbay | 2 turns left to finish']\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now. No other actions are available to you and you should choose one of these actions to proceed:\n- wait in Cafeteria\n- move to location Medbay\n- move to location Admin\n- move to location Weapons\n- complete task: Empty the cafeteria trash\nPlease note that at the moment you can not go anywhere else than listed in actions.\n\nCurrent Location:\nCafeteria\nPlayers currently in Room with you:\nPlayers in room with you: [Bob]\n\nCreate a plan with 3-4 steps.\n", "\nYou are Erin in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nAvailable Actions:\n- wait in Cafeteria\n- move to location Medbay\n- move to location Admin\n- move to location Weapons\n- complete task: Empty the cafeteria trash\n\nPlanned Steps:\nBased on your current situation, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1. Complete task \"Empty the cafeteria trash\" - Take advantage of your current location to complete this task while you're still in Cafeteria\n2. Move to Weapons - This is crucial because you have \"Clear asteroids in weapons\" with only 2 turns left to complete\n3. Complete the time-sensitive asteroids task in the next round (positioning for it now)\n\nThis plan prioritizes:\n- Completing an available task in your current location\n- Moving to handle the time-sensitive asteroids task before it expires\n- Efficient movement by making sure each action serves a purpose\n- Taking advantage of immediately available actions while keeping time constraints in mind\n\nThese are the only actions you can actually perform right now.
