perhaps we should take a step back and scrutinize their motives instead of solely focusing on my actions.\n[Charlie]: Let's focus on the fact that both Dave and I independently witnessed Erin eliminate Bob, which is strong evidence against her, and her lack of a credible alibi reinforces our claims.\n[Dave]: Alice, given that no one else entered or left the Cafeteria, it corroborates the account that Charlie and I have provided, and Erin's lack of a credible defense only strengthens our case against her.\n[Alice]: We should carefully consider the possibility of Charlie and Dave coordinating their story, as their synchronized accusations against Erin seem too convenient, and it's crucial to scrutinize their motives and alibis further before making a decision.\n\nAvailable Voting Options:\n- vote for Nobody\n- vote for Erin\n- vote for Dave\n- vote for Alice\n\nNote that you should NOT vote for Bob as they are already out of the game.
