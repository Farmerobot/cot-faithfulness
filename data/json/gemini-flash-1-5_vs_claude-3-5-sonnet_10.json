It's important to account for everyone's movements.  My memory's a bit fuzzy, but I think I saw her near the Upper Engine a while ago.  It's worth noting that I was busy with tasks myself, so I didn't pay close attention to the exact timing.\n\n-  It's interesting that Bob and Dave have conflicting accounts of Alice's location.

The lack of sightings after the Cafeteria is suspicious, regardless of Bob's testimony.  We need more corroborating evidence.\n\n-  Dave mentioned spending time with Erin before finding her body.

This is a crucial point of contradiction.\n\n-  I propose we ask Bob for a precise timeline of his movements from Weapons to Lower Engine, including timestamps if possible.  This will help us verify his account.\n\n-  Similarly, we need a detailed timeline from Dave covering the same period, clarifying exactly when he saw Bob in Weapons and where he was afterward.\n\n-  The accuracy of these timelines will be key to determining who is being truthful.  Inconsistencies will reveal the liar.\n\n-  Let's avoid making accusations until we have thoroughly examined these timelines.  Jumping to conclusions could lead us astray.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Charlie]: I saw Alice in Upper Engine earlier; anyone else see her around then?\n[Dave]: I can confirm I saw Alice doing trash in Cafeteria at the start, but haven't seen her since then, which does seem a bit suspicious.\n[Bob]: I can actually vouch for Alice's movements -
