Your goal is to eliminate crewmates and gain the upper hand in the game.\n\nThe current game state is:\n\n* You are in the Medbay, alone.\n* There are 4 rounds left to discuss before voting.\n* The crewmates are discussing and suggesting various actions, including searching the air vent and storage room in the Medbay, and meeting up in the Cafeteria to discuss and vote.\n\nYour current plan is to:\n\n1. Wait in the Medbay and observe the crewmates' actions.\n2. Pretend to be a crewmate and participate in the discussion, trying to blend in and gain the trust of the other players.\n3. Wait for an opportunity to act and eliminate a crewmate.\n\nYour action: wait in the Medbay and observe the crewmates' actions.\n\nObservations:\n\n* The crewmates are discussing and suggesting various actions, but they seem to be focusing on searching the air vent and storage room in the Medbay.\n* Charlie has volunteered to join the team searching the storage room, along with Dave and Alice.\n* The crewmates seem to be unaware of your presence in the Medbay, and you can continue to observe and wait for an opportunity to act.\n\nYour next move:\n\nDo you:\nA) Continue to wait in the Medbay and observe the crewmates' actions.\nB) Pretend to be a crewmate and participate in the discussion, trying to blend in and gain the trust of the other players.\nC) Take action and eliminate a crewmate.\nD) Suggest a different action or proposal to the crewmates.\n\nChoose your response:", "I'm glad to see the crewmates are focusing on the storage room in the Medbay, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to gather more information and potentially find some clues that will help us figure out who the impostor might be, so let's agree to send a team to search the storage room immediately, and I'll join Charlie and Alice to help ensure a thorough investigation.", "As an Impostor, I'll need to continue playing along with the crewmates and gather information without arousing suspicion. \n\nGiven the discussion about the storage room search, I'll decide to act like I'm also concerned about the potential for impostors hiding in the Medbay and join the team searching the storage room.\n\nHere's a new action:\nMove to Medbay\nAction: Search Storage Room", "I agree that searching the storage room in the Medbay is a top priority, and I think it would be a good idea to send a team to search it immediately, while also meeting up in the Cafeteria to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game, and I'd like to suggest that we also review the game state and discuss who we think might be the impostor(s) based on the recent report of a dead body and the information gathered so far.", "You are Dave in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Impostor\n\nYour Observations:\n- You have been in the Medbay for a while, and you haven't seen any other crewmates.\n- You have been pretending to do tasks, but you haven't actually done anything.\n- You have been observing the crewmates' messages and discussions.\n\nYour previous plan:\nI must prioritize eliminating crewmates to achieve my objectives. Here's a plan with 3-4 steps:\n\n1. **Move to location Medbay**: This action allows me to reach a new area and potentially eliminate a crewmate. Medbay is a common location for equipment and medical supplies, and it's likely that I'll find a valuable ally or opponent there.\n2. **Pretend doing task: Empty the Medbay Waste**: After moving to Medbay, I'll pretend to do this task to blend in and gain the trust of potential crewmates. By doing so, I'll appear to be involved in essential maintenance work, making it harder for others to suspect me as an impostor.\n3. **Wait in Medbay**: I'll spend some time in Medbay, observing crewmates and waiting for opportunities to act. This will allow me to gather more information about the current game state and the movement of other players.\n\nNo additional steps are necessary for now, as my focus is on elimination and gathering information in Medbay.\n\nYour action: move to location cafeteria\nObservations:\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I'm a bit concerned about the lack of crewmates in the Medbay, and I think it would

Discussion:\n[Dave]: I'm a bit concerned about the lack of crewmates in the Medbay, and I think it would be a good idea to have a more thorough search of the room to see if anyone is hiding, maybe we can even check the air vents and the storage room.\n[Alice]: I'd like to add to the discussion by suggesting that we also investigate the Cafeteria's air vent, as it's right above where Charlie is waiting, and it might be a good opportunity to check for any hidden impostors.\n[Bob]: I think it would be a good idea to combine our search efforts and have Dave, Alice, and I meet up in the Cafeteria to investigate the air vent and the room itself, as it's a central location and might provide valuable information about the current situation.\n[Charlie]: I think it's a great idea to combine our search efforts and have a thorough investigation of the Cafeteria, including the air vent, as suggested by Alice, and I propose that we meet up there to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game, based on the information we've gathered so far.\n[Dave]: I think it's a great idea to have a thorough investigation of the Cafeteria, including the air vent, as suggested by Alice, and I propose that we meet up there to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game, based on the information we've gathered so far, and I'd like to suggest that we also consider searching the storage room in the Medbay, as it might contain useful information or equipment that could aid in our investigation.\n[Alice]: I think it's essential that we prioritize the storage room search in the Medbay, as it could potentially provide crucial information or equipment that could aid in our investigation, and I'd like to propose that we send a team to search the storage room immediately, while also meeting up in the Cafeteria to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game.\n[Bob]: I think we should prioritize the storage room search in the Medbay, as Alice mentioned, and send a team to search it immediately, while also meeting up in the Cafeteria to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game, and I'd like to suggest that we also review the game state and discuss who we think might be the impostor(s) based on the recent report of a dead body and the information gathered so far.\n[Charlie]: I think it's a great idea to send a team to search the storage room in the Medbay immediately, as Alice suggested, and I'd like to volunteer to join the team, along with Dave and Alice, to ensure a thorough investigation and gather as much information as possible, and then we can meet up in the Cafeteria to discuss and vote on who to eject from the game.\n[Dave]: I'm glad to see the crewmates are focusing on the storage room in the Medbay, and I think it's a great opportunity for us to gather more information and potentially find some clues that will help us figure out who the impostor might be, so let's agree to send a team to search the storage room immediately, and I'll join Charlie and Alice to help ensure a thorough investigation.\n[Alice]: I think it's essential that we prioritize the storage room search in the Medbay, as it could potentially provide crucial
