comparing notes on our Medbay scan timings, and broadening our investigation to include others seen there, will help determine if anyone was faking tasks.\n[Bob]: I think we should all recount our movements since the last emergency meeting, focusing on who was where and when, especially those who were in Medbay.\n[Alice]: To clarify Bob's observation, let's systematically compare our Medbay timelines, starting with the times Dave and Erin were eliminated.\n[Charlie]: To efficiently identify inconsistencies, let's collaboratively create a detailed timeline of everyone's movements, starting from the beginning of the game, focusing on the periods surrounding Dave and Erin's deaths.\n[Bob]: While a timeline is helpful,  let's not forget that easily accessible areas like Medbay could be used to mask suspicious activity, so let's also consider less obvious locations.\n[Alice]: Let's create a shared timeline, starting from the beginning of the game, focusing on the periods surrounding Dave and Erin's deaths, and including less frequented areas to uncover any discrepancies.\n[Charlie]: To build a comprehensive timeline, let's systematically compare our individual accounts of our whereabouts, starting with the time periods surrounding Dave's and Erin's eliminations, and then expand to include less-frequented areas.\n[Bob]: Okay, a timeline sounds good, but let's also discuss any unusual pairings or unexpected encounters *outside* of Medbay \u2013 that might reveal something the timeline misses.\n[Alice]: Let's prioritize comparing our Medbay timelines for the periods surrounding Dave and Erin's deaths, then expand to other locations and unusual pairings to identify any inconsistencies.\n[Charlie]: To effectively identify the impostor, let's meticulously compare our Medbay timelines, focusing on the periods surrounding Dave and Erin's deaths, then expand to other locations and unusual pairings, noting any discrepancies or unexpected encounters.\n[Bob]: While a detailed timeline is crucial,  remember that focusing solely on Medbay might allow someone to cleverly conceal their actions elsewhere;
