Alice being the one to report them doesn't automatically clear her.\n- If I had been the impostor, why would I have drawn attention to Charlie's movements if I knew they were innocent? It doesn't add up.\n- Dave, you mentioned tracking movements closely. Can you account for Alice's whereabouts during the time of the murders?\n- It's possible that someone is trying to frame me by taking advantage of my absence during the critical period. We should look at everyone's actions and not just focus on me.\n- We need to be careful about jumping to conclusions based on who reported the bodies.

I saw her completing tasks in both Cafeteria (empty trash) and Admin (cleaning floor)\n\n- I also saw Bob doing legitimate tasks in both Cafeteria (coffee maker) and Admin (cleaning floor), which makes me somewhat hesitant about Alice's suspicion of him\n\n- However, I lost track of Bob after the Admin tasks, and it's concerning that he was so quick to accuse Charlie who turned out to be a victim\n\n- I observed Erin doing a task in Lower Engine (checking catalyzer) before they were killed, which means they were actively contributing\n\n- The timing is important here - I saw Alice in Electrical doing the power routing task, then she went to Lower Engine, which aligns with her eventually finding the bodies in Storage\n\n- Given my observations, I think we need more information about where Bob was during the middle portion of the game, as I haven't seen him for quite a while\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I've been in Admin and Storage, and while I haven't seen anything too suspicious, we should focus on those who move around a lot without doing tasks\u2014any thoughts on Charlie's movements?\n[Alice]: I agree with Bob's observation about Charlie -

I saw Bob doing tasks in Cafeteria (fixing wiring and starting coffee maker) and Admin (cleaning floor), and Alice completing tasks in Cafeteria (trash) and Admin (cleaning floor)\n\n- I followed Alice to Electrical later and witnessed her routing power to defence, so she's definitely completing tasks\n\n- I also saw Erin doing a task (Check catalyzer) in Lower Engine, so they seem to be doing their part\n\n- I agree that Charlie is suspicious - I only saw them move from Cafeteria to Weapons early on, and haven't seen them since.

I only saw them move from Cafeteria to Weapons early on, and haven't seen them since. No observed task completion from them\n\n- I've been moving around quite a bit trying to track others, but I can confirm several legitimate task completions from Bob, Alice, and Erin", "Since I've been tracking everyone's movements closely, I can confirm that Bob and Alice are telling the truth about Charlie's suspicious behavior -

I saw her completing tasks in both Cafeteria (empty trash) and Admin (cleaning floor)\n\n- I also saw Bob doing legitimate tasks in both Cafeteria (coffee maker) and Admin (cleaning floor), which makes me somewhat hesitant about Alice's suspicion of him\n\n- However, I lost track of Bob after the Admin tasks, and it's concerning that he was so quick to accuse Charlie who turned out to be a victim\n\n- I observed Erin doing a task in Lower Engine (checking catalyzer) before they were killed, which means they were actively contributing\n\n- The timing is important here - I saw Alice in Electrical doing the power routing task, then she went to Lower Engine, which aligns with her eventually finding the bodies in Storage\n\n- Given my observations, I think we need more information about where Bob was during the middle portion of the game, as I haven't seen him for quite a while", "Given that I saw Bob early game but lost track of him later, and he was suspiciously quick to accuse Charlie who turned out to be a victim, I think we need to focus our investigation on Bob's whereabouts during the time leading up to the murders in Storage.", "Based on the discussion and my observations, I'll contribute these points:\n\n- I can provide a clear timeline of Bob's movements: I saw him doing tasks in Cafeteria early on (Fix wiring and Start coffee maker), then in Admin (Clean the floor), but after that he disappeared from my sight for a long period\n- Alice's story checks out - she was with me in multiple locations (Cafeteria, Admin, Storage, Electrical) and I saw her completing actual tasks\n- The timing is suspicious - Bob was last seen by me in Admin, which is right next to Storage where the bodies were found\n- I think it's telling that Bob first tried to direct suspicion to Charlie, who turned out to be a victim, and is now trying to broaden the investigation instead of explaining his whereabouts\n- I believe we should vote for Bob based on his suspicious behavior pattern and unaccounted time during the murders", "I can confirm that I saw Bob doing tasks early on, but he was notably absent during the critical period when the murders occurred in Storage, and his attempt to first accuse Charlie and now deflect attention is highly suspicious.", "Based on the discussion and my observations, I'll contribute these points:\n\n- I can provide a detailed timeline of Bob's movements: I saw him doing tasks in Cafeteria early on, then in Admin, but after that he disappeared for a long period\n- Alice's movements have been consistent and transparent -

Dave in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nBased on the discussion and my observations as a crewmate, I'll contribute these key points:\n\n- I want to emphasize that I personally witnessed Alice completing multiple tasks throughout the game, including \"Clean the floor in admin\" and \"Route power to defence in electrical\"\n- Bob's behavior follows a classic impostor pattern: first accusing Charlie (who turned out to be dead), then trying to deflect to a general movement review, and finally attempting to cast suspicion on Alice for finding the bodies\n- My early game observations show Bob in Admin and Cafeteria, but he disappears from view during the critical period when the murders occurred\n- The timeline matches with Alice's story - she was consistently visible doing tasks, while Bob had significant gaps in his whereabouts\n- I strongly recommend we vote for Bob based on the mounting evidence against him and his increasingly desperate attempts to shift blame\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I've been in Admin and Storage, and while I haven't seen anything too suspicious, we should focus on those who move around a lot
