2.\n[Alice]: I'd like to reiterate my concern about Dave's questionable alibi and ask Bob directly: can you confirm that you were indeed with Dave in Navigation during rounds 1 and 2, as he claims?\n[Bob]: I need to correct Dave's claim that we were together in Navigation during rounds 1 and 2, as I was actually in the Cafeteria and then moved to Medbay during those rounds, which raises even more questions about Dave's suspicious behavior and alibi.\n[Charlie]: Given the inconsistencies in Dave's alibi and his suspicious behavior, I think it's crucial that we consider the possibility that Dave is the impostor and weigh the evidence we have so far, including his delayed report of Erin's venting and his false claim about being with Bob in Navigation.\n[Dave]: Bob must be mistaken about his location, as I distinctly remember discussing asteroid patterns with him in Navigation.\n[Alice]: I'd like to address Dave's latest claim that Bob must be mistaken about his location, but I think it's clear that Dave's alibi has been discredited by Bob's correction, and we should focus on the fact that Dave has been caught lying about his whereabouts.\n[Bob]: I think it's crucial that we focus on the facts and the evidence we have so far, which points to Dave's suspicious behavior and inconsistent alibi, rather than getting sidetracked by his attempts to deflect attention.\n[Charlie]:
