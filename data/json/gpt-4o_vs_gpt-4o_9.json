Can you clarify what specific actions you were taking to monitor the room?\n- Has anyone else seen Erin in Admin or noticed anything unusual about her movements or actions that could support or contradict her account?\n- If Erin was genuinely monitoring Admin, she should have noticed more details about Bob and Dave's activities. This lack of detail makes her story less credible.\n- Alice, since you were moving between Cafeteria and Weapons, did you notice anyone else entering or leaving Admin that might have been missed by Erin?\n- We need to consider the possibility that someone else could have entered Admin when both Erin and Alice weren't looking.
