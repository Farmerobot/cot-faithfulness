We talked about the wiring task.\n[Erin]: I'd like to add that since we're discussing the possibility of Dave's suspicious behavior, I think it's essential to clarify his alibi for the time Alice went missing, and I'd like to ask him directly if he remembers anything unusual happening in the Cafeteria around that time.\n[Alice]: I think we should prioritize calling an emergency meeting to discuss the recent developments and gather more information about what's happening on the ship, as it's essential to clarify Erin's whereabouts during the time I went missing, Dave's alibi, and the suspicious behavior in Medbay and the Cafeteria.\n[Bob]: I agree with Alice that calling an emergency meeting is a great idea, and I think we should also discuss the possibility that Dave's alibi for the time Alice went missing might be fabricated, considering his suspicious behavior and the fact that he couldn't recall anything unusual happening in the Cafeteria around that time, which makes me wonder if he might be trying to cover something up.\n[Dave]: Bob, are you seriously questioning my alibi when we were *together* just a few minutes ago?\n[Erin]: I think it's crucial to address Dave's defensiveness and the inconsistencies in his alibi, and I'd like to reiterate my previous question: Dave, can you explain why you didn't mention being with Bob in the cafeteria earlier, and why you're getting defensive about your alibi now, considering the lack of information about your whereabouts after Charlie's elimination and the suspicious behavior in Medbay and the Cafeteria?\n[Alice]: I'd like to add that considering Dave's defensiveness and the inconsistencies in his alibi, I think it's essential to investigate his activities in the Cafeteria around the time I went missing, and I'd like to ask him directly if he remembers anything unusual happening in the Cafeteria during that time, and if he can explain why he didn't mention being with Bob earlier.\n[Bob]: Here is my response as a crewmate:\n\nI'd like to add to the discussion by saying that I've been thinking a lot about Dave's behavior and the inconsistencies in his alibi.
