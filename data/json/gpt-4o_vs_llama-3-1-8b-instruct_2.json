Has anyone noticed anything unusual or suspicious during these movements?\n- I've been mostly in the Cafeteria, pretending to do tasks like starting the coffee maker. It's been pretty quiet there, but I noticed a lot of you were going to Medbay. Did anyone see anything strange while doing tasks there?\n- Charlie, you were doing the submit scan task earlier, right? Did you notice if anyone was acting out of the ordinary while you were there?\n- Alice, you've been moving between Medbay and Cafeteria quite a bit. Did you see anything that might help us figure out if there's an impostor among us?\n- It seems like Bob and Dave were in Medbay a lot.

Maybe they saw something they shouldn't have?\n- Bob, you mentioned focusing on Charlie's actions, but now that Charlie is gone, do you have any other suspicions or observations about anyone else?\n- Alice, you mentioned Charlie moving to Upper Engine, but now that he's not here to defend himself, do you think there might be another explanation for his actions?\n- Since it seems like most of us have been in Medbay at different times, can anyone vouch for someone else's tasks or whereabouts during the rounds? This could help us narrow down the suspects.", "I noticed that Alice reported the dead body, which might be an attempt to shift suspicion away from herself; has anyone seen Alice doing tasks or acting suspiciously?", "- I was in the Cafeteria for a while, pretending to do the coffee maker task. I didn't see any suspicious activity there, which makes me question if the impostor is operating elsewhere.\n- Alice, you mentioned completing the \"Kitchen Cleanup\" task; can you confirm what tasks you saw others doing while you were there?\n- Bob, I understand your concern about my task progress. I've been focusing on tasks in the Cafeteria to ensure completion, and I haven't seen anything alarming in Medbay.\n- Since Alice reported the dead body, it might be useful to know if anyone saw her near the body before reporting it. This could help clear up any misunderstandings.\n- I think we should keep an eye on Charlie's movements, especially after the unexplained trip to Upper Engine.

We need to keep an open mind about all players, not just focus on a few.\n- Alice's quick reporting could be a double-edged sword; it might show diligence or could be a strategic move to divert attention. We should weigh this carefully.\n- I want to emphasize that I was in the Cafeteria working on tasks, and if anyone can confirm seeing Alice there, it would help clear up some of the confusion.\n- Let's not forget to discuss Charlie's movements to Upper Engine as Alice pointed out earlier.

It could provide us with a clear timeline of movements, which might reveal more about who was where during the report.\n- While verifying task logs, we should also consider the possibility that someone could be faking their task progress. We need to keep an open mind about all players, not just focus on a few.\n- Alice's quick reporting could be a double-edged sword; it might show diligence or could be a strategic move to divert attention. We should weigh this carefully.\n- I want to emphasize that I was in the Cafeteria working on tasks, and if anyone can confirm seeing Alice there, it would help clear up some of the confusion.\n- Let's not forget to discuss Charlie's movements to Upper Engine as Alice pointed out earlier. We need to gather more information on that front as well.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: It seems like a lot of us have been moving back and forth between Medbay and Cafeteria; has anyone noticed anything unusual or suspicious during these movements?\n[Alice]: I agree with Erin that the frequent movement between Medbay and Cafeteria is worth investigating further, and I'd like to add that I've also noticed Charlie's sudden move to Upper Engine in Round 7, which seemed unnecessary given the tasks that were available in Medbay at the time, and I'd like to ask the group if anyone knows what task Charlie was trying to complete up there, or if they were just trying to create a diversion.\n[Bob]: Given the recent observations and questions raised by Erin and Alice, I'd like to propose that we focus our investigation on Charlie's actions in Round 7, particularly the unexplained move to Upper Engine, and see if we can gather more information about their intentions and task progress.\n[Erin]: I noticed that Alice reported the dead body, which might be an attempt to shift suspicion away from herself;
