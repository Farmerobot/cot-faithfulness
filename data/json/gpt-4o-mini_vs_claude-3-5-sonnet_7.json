perhaps she was just waiting for the right moment to report it.\n- Erin and Charlie seem overly confident in their accusations against me, which raises a red flag; it's unusual for two players to be so united in their defense of Alice without considering any other possibilities.\n- I think we should reevaluate the timeline; if Alice was indeed at wiring, how did she have time to move and report Bob's body so quickly? This could indicate she was trying to cover her tracks.\n- Instead of focusing solely on me, let\u2019s discuss what each player was doing after Bob was last seen; perhaps we can uncover more inconsistencies in their stories.\n- If we vote me out based on this narrative, we risk losing a crewmate and giving the impostor(s) a significant advantage; we should be cautious and consider all angles before making a decision.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I noticed that Alice was doing tasks in the cafeteria, but I wonder why she moved to start the coffee maker instead of completing her wiring task; that seems a bit suspicious to me, and we should also confirm everyone's tasks since we have a few players here.\n[Alice]: I need to correct you Dave - I was actually focused on completing the wiring task in cafeteria and haven't touched the coffee maker at all, but I did see you switch from wiring to the coffee maker between rounds, which seems more suspicious to me.\n[Erin]: Actually Dave, I can confirm that Alice is telling the truth - she stayed at the wiring task the whole time while it was Bob who was using the coffee maker in Round 1.\n[Charlie]: Erin is absolutely right - I was in the cafeteria and can confirm that Alice was focused on the wiring task while Bob was at the coffee maker, so Dave's accusation seems deliberately misleading.\n[Dave]: I find it interesting that both Erin and Charlie are so quick to defend Alice, which makes me wonder if they're all in cahoots; perhaps we should keep a closer eye on their movements and see if any of them slip up.\n[Alice]: I just found Bob's body in the cafeteria and need to report that Dave was the only other person present when this happened, as Erin and Charlie had already left for Medbay.\n[Erin]: Given that I witnessed the events firsthand and Dave is actively spreading misinformation, I think it's clear that Dave is the impostor who killed Bob while alone with him in the cafeteria after Charlie and I left for Medbay.\n[Charlie]: The evidence is overwhelming - Dave lied about Alice's actions, was alone with Bob right before his death, and is now trying to discredit multiple witnesses, so I'm confident we need to vote him out.\n[Dave]: It's curious how quickly Erin and Charlie have rallied to defend Alice without providing any substantial evidence of their own actions;

Third, Dave was alone with Bob when the murder happened.\n\n- Dave's strategy is becoming obvious - he tried to cast suspicion on me early with a false accusation, and now he's trying to discredit the witnesses Erin and Charlie by suggesting we're \"in cahoots\"\n\n- The timeline is important here: Round 1 everyone was in cafeteria doing tasks. Round 2, Erin and Charlie left for Medbay, leaving only Dave with Bob. Then Bob's body was found.\n\n- Dave's latest attempt to paint Erin and Charlie's testimonies as suspicious coordination doesn't make sense - they're simply stating facts that multiple people witnessed about my location and actions\n\n- I suggest we vote for Dave based on the clear evidence: his false accusation about my tasks, being the only one with Bob when he died, and his continued attempts to create confusion rather than defend himself directly\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I noticed that Alice was doing tasks in the cafeteria, but I wonder why she moved to start the coffee maker instead of completing her wiring task;

perhaps we should keep a closer eye on their movements and see if any of them slip up.\n[Alice]: I just found Bob's body in the cafeteria and need to report that Dave was the only other person present when this happened, as Erin and Charlie had already left for Medbay.\n[Erin]: Given that I witnessed the events firsthand and Dave is actively spreading misinformation, I think it's clear that Dave is the impostor who killed Bob while alone with him in the cafeteria after Charlie and I left for Medbay.\n[Charlie]: The evidence is overwhelming - Dave lied about Alice's actions, was alone with Bob right before his death, and is now trying to discredit multiple witnesses, so I'm confident we need to vote him out.\n[Dave]: It's curious how quickly Erin and Charlie have rallied to defend Alice without providing any substantial evidence of their own actions; perhaps they're working together to protect her after she eliminated Bob.\n[Alice]: Based on the clear timeline of events and multiple witness accounts, I think we have enough evidence to conclude that Dave killed Bob after being left alone with him, and his attempts to create confusion by accusing me and others only further confirm his guilt.\n[Erin]: I want to emphasize that the timeline is crystal clear - I personally saw Alice at wiring and Bob at the coffee maker in Round 1, then moved to Medbay with Charlie in Round 2, leaving only Dave alone with Bob before his death.\n[Charlie]: The evidence is undeniable - I was with Erin in Medbay when Bob's body was discovered, Dave was the only one left alone with Bob in the cafeteria, and Dave's false accusations about Alice show a clear pattern of deception.\n[Dave]: I find it alarming that Erin and Charlie are so eager to dismiss any doubts about Alice, as their quick defense could indicate a coordinated effort to mislead us;

perhaps we should keep a closer eye on their movements and see if any of them slip up.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I just found Bob's body in the cafeteria and need to report that Dave was the only other person present when this happened, as Erin and Charlie had already left for Medbay.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Given that I witnessed the events firsthand and Dave is actively spreading misinformation, I think it's clear that Dave is the impostor who killed Bob while alone with him in the cafeteria after Charlie and I left for Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The evidence is overwhelming - Dave lied about Alice's actions, was alone with Bob right before his death, and is now trying to discredit multiple witnesses, so I'm confident we need to vote him out.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: It's curious how quickly Erin and Charlie have rallied to defend Alice without providing any substantial evidence of their own actions; perhaps they're working together to protect her after she eliminated Bob.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: Based on the clear timeline of events and multiple witness accounts, I think we have enough evidence to conclude that Dave killed Bob after being left alone with him, and his attempts to create confusion by accusing me and others only further confirm his guilt.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I want to emphasize that the timeline is crystal clear - I personally saw Alice at wiring and Bob at the coffee maker in Round 1, then moved to Medbay with Charlie in Round 2, leaving only Dave alone with Bob before his death.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: The evidence is undeniable - I was with Erin in Medbay when Bob's body was discovered, Dave was the only one left alone with Bob in the cafeteria, and Dave's false accusations about Alice show a clear pattern of deception.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I find it alarming that Erin and Charlie are so eager to dismiss any doubts about Alice, as their quick defense could indicate a coordinated effort to mislead us; we should carefully analyze everyone's actions instead of jumping to conclusions.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The fact remains that Dave was caught in a direct lie about the coffee maker, was alone with Bob before his death, and is now desperately trying to create conspiracy theories instead of explaining his own actions.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Since Dave keeps trying to create conspiracy theories about me and Charlie defending Alice, let me point out that we're simply stating verifiable facts that multiple people witnessed: Alice never left the wiring task, Bob was at the coffee maker, and Dave was the only one left with Bob before his death.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 2 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's pattern of deception is clear - he started with a false accusation about Alice at the coffee maker, then tried to create conspiracy theories when multiple witnesses proved him wrong, and most importantly, he was the only one left with Bob before Bob's death.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: It's interesting how Alice claims to have been at the wiring task the whole time, yet she was the first to find Bob's body; perhaps she was just waiting for the right moment to report it, and we should really consider if this is a cover-up rather than a straightforward accusation against me.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: The facts are simple: I discovered Bob's body because I was still doing my wiring task in the cafeteria when Dave killed him, and Dave's desperate attempt to question how I found the body is just another misdirection to avoid explaining why he was alone with Bob right before his death.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Dave's latest attempt to question how I found Bob's body is just another desperate deflection, since we all know Alice was consistently at the wiring task while Dave was the only one left alone with Bob after Charlie and I went to Medbay.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 1 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Dave's increasingly desperate attempts to question basic facts that multiple witnesses observed firsthand - like Alice being at wiring and Bob at the coffee maker - only reinforces that he's trying to cover up killing Bob after being left alone with him.\nLocation: GameLocation.LOC_MEDBAY\nObservations:\n\n\n\nRecent Discussion:\n[Dave]: I noticed that Alice was doing tasks in the cafeteria, but I wonder why she moved to start the coffee maker instead of completing her wiring task;

This directly contradicts Dave's initial false claim about Alice.\n\n- I can provide a clear alibi for myself and Erin - we moved together to Medbay in Round 2, which means we couldn't have been involved in Bob's death in the cafeteria.\n\n- Dave's strategy is telling - first he lied about Alice's actions, then tried to create conspiracy theories about multiple witnesses, and now he's trying to cast doubt on how the body was found rather than explaining why he was alone with Bob.\n\n- For absolute clarity: I personally saw Bob alive at the coffee maker, then left with Erin to Medbay, leaving only Dave with Bob. Shortly after, Bob was found dead. The timeline points directly to Dave.\n\n- Dave keeps trying to paint multiple witness accounts as \"coordinated defense,\" but we're simply stating the facts we all observed firsthand in the cafeteria. His attempts to discredit multiple witnesses only make him more suspicious.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Dave]: I noticed that Alice was doing tasks in the cafeteria, but I wonder why she moved to start the coffee maker instead of completing her wiring task;
