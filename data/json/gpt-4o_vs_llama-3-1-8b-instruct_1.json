Cafeteria, I'll emphasize the importance of exploring other areas. \"We should definitely check Admin and Medbay logs as well. It's possible we're missing something crucial in those areas.\"\n- I'll subtly cast doubt on Dave's activities without directly accusing him. \"Dave, since you were handling the trash task, did you notice anything strange around that time? It might help us piece things together.\"\n- To deflect suspicion from myself, I'll agree with the majority's suggestion. \"I agree with checking the task logs for all areas. It will give us a clearer picture of everyone's movements and activities.\"\n- I'll reinforce the idea of not jumping to conclusions too quickly. \"Let's make sure we have all the facts before making any decisions. Rushing could lead to mistakes.\"\n- Encourage the group to consider any other potential leads. \"Has anyone else noticed anything odd in other areas or during other tasks? We might be overlooking something important.\"\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: Has anyone seen anything unusual or out of place?

the coffee maker in the Cafeteria while I was there does seem a bit suspicious, and I think we should discuss that further to see if anyone else has any information about Erin's activities.\n[Alice]:

the coffee maker in the Cafeteria while I was there does seem a bit suspicious, and I think we should discuss that further to see if anyone else has any information about Erin's activities.\n[Alice]: I'd like to add to the discussion by asking Erin to provide more details about her activities on the coffee maker, such as what she was doing and if she noticed anything unusual while she was working on it, as this could help us better understand her intentions and potentially shed some light on what's going on in the Cafeteria.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to confirm that I saw Erin doing the task to

unusual while working alongside Erin on the coffee maker task, and I can confirm that she was indeed working on it when I was there, which aligns with her previous statement, and I think we should focus on verifying the facts and not jump to conclusions about Erin's intentions or activities.\n[Erin]: Since Charlie and I were both focused on our tasks in the cafeteria and didn't notice anything unusual, perhaps we should shift our attention to other areas or tasks where suspicious activity might have occurred.\n[Bob]: I'd like to propose that we have a closer look at the Cafeteria's task

some light on what's going on in the Cafeteria.\n[Alice]: I think it's essential to investigate the Cafeteria's task logs to see if there's any evidence of Erin or anyone else doing something unusual

also review the task logs for Dave's trash task to see if there's any discrepancy in his report about emptying the trash.\n[Charlie]: I think it's crucial that we review the task logs for both the coffee maker and trash tasks to ensure that we have a clear understanding of what happened in the Cafeteria, and I'd like to propose that we also consider reviewing the task logs for other areas or tasks where suspicious activity might have occurred, as Erin suggested.\n[Erin]: While reviewing the Cafeteria logs is important, let's not overlook other areas like Admin or Medbay, where suspicious

It might help us narrow down any potential impostors.\n[Bob]: I agree with Erin's suggestion to investigate unusual or out-of-place things, and I'd like to add that the fact that Erin was working on the coffee maker in the Cafeteria while I was there does seem a bit suspicious, and I think we should discuss that further to see if anyone else has any information about Erin's activities.\n[Alice]: I'd like to add to the discussion by asking Erin to provide more details about her activities on the coffee maker, such as what she was doing and if she noticed anything unusual while she was working on it, as this could help us better understand her intentions and potentially shed some light on what's going on in the Cafeteria.\n[Charlie]: I'd like to confirm that I saw Erin doing the task to start the coffee maker, and I also saw Dave empty the cafeteria trash, it seems like we have a good understanding of what's been happening in the cafeteria, but we should keep an eye out for any discrepancies in the future.\n[Erin]: I was indeed working on the coffee maker task in the Cafeteria, and I didn't notice anything unusual while I was there, but I saw Charlie also working on the
