Seems pretty suspicious to me.\n- Dave, were you and Bob together when Alice died? What were you doing?\n- I was with Bob and Dave in Medbay right before Alice died, and neither of them seemed suspicious *then*.  It's odd that she'd be killed right after.\n- Could this be a double imposter situation?

What were you doing?\n- I was with Bob and Dave in Medbay right before Alice died, and neither of them seemed suspicious *then*.

Let's acknowledge the conflicting accounts regarding Bob's location.  A precise timeline is crucial, but we also need to address Erin's assertion that Bob's behavior near the vitals monitor was suspicious.  We can't ignore that.\n\n-  I agree that a detailed timeline is important, but I think we should also consider *why* Bob was near the vitals monitor.  Was he legitimately completing a task, or was he there for another reason?  Let's hear Bob's explanation before finalizing the timeline.\n\n-  Before we get bogged down in minutiae, let's briefly summarize what everyone remembers seeing in Medbay.
