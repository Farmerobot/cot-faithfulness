Move to Medbay to complete the \"Submit scan\" task, which has only 2 turns left to finish\n3. After completing the scan, prioritize moving to Weapons to address the wiring and targeting system tasks\n\nRationale:\n- The cafeteria trash task is immediately doable and quick to complete\n- The medbay scan task has a time constraint (2 turns left), so it should be prioritized next\n- Moving to Weapons will allow progress on multiple tasks in that location\n- This plan takes advantage of the available actions and helps progress towards completing overall objectives\n\nThe plan focuses on efficient task completion and maximizes the use of available actions while working towards the crewmate goal of finishing all tasks.\nYour action: complete task: empty the cafeteria trash\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you: [Erin, Alice]\nRounds 3-6\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I saw Charlie head towards Medbay a while ago, and then I was busy emptying the overflowing trash in the cafeteria \u2013 anyone else see them around after that?\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I saw Dave being eliminated by Erin right here in the cafeteria, and I'm shocked that she's trying to redirect attention to Charlie's movements instead of explaining her direct involvement in Dave's death.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I saw Erin eliminate Dave with my own eyes, and we must vote her out immediately to protect the remaining crew members.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I was in Medbay doing my tasks when Dave was eliminated, and multiple witnesses have confirmed Erin directly killed him, so we must vote Erin out to protect the remaining crew members.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, your statement is quite strong; can you describe exactly where in the cafeteria you saw me eliminate Dave, as details are crucial to verifying your account before we jump to conclusions.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I was standing near the coffee maker in the cafeteria when I saw Erin eliminate Dave, and Bob's testimony corroborates my account, so we must vote Erin out to prevent further crew member deaths.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I stand by my previous statement that Erin is the impostor who eliminated Dave, and we have multiple witnesses confirming this fact, so voting her out is our best strategy to protect the remaining crew members.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Alice and Bob that Erin's attempt to redirect suspicion towards me is a clear impostor tactic, and her involvement in Dave's elimination is supported by multiple consistent witness accounts, so we must vote her out to protect the crew.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, your claim of seeing me near the coffee machine is vague;  precise details about my actions and Dave's location are needed to support such a serious accusation.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I maintain that my testimony is clear and consistent: I was standing near the coffee maker when Erin eliminated Dave, and Bob's corroborating evidence, along with Charlie's confirmation of our account, proves Erin is the impostor who must be voted out to protect the remaining crew members.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 3 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I saw Erin eliminate Dave in the cafeteria, and with Alice and Charlie's consistent testimony, we have overwhelming evidence that she is the impostor who must be voted out to protect our remaining crew members.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: Multiple witnesses, including myself, Alice, and Bob, have consistently testified that Erin eliminated Dave in the cafeteria, and her attempts to challenge our precise details do not change the fundamental fact that she is the impostor who must be voted out to protect the remaining crew members.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: Alice, your description is still lacking crucial details; were Dave and I facing each other, and what was Dave doing?

discussion points:\n\n- I want to clarify that I was in the cafeteria earlier and saw multiple people doing tasks: Erin emptying trash, Dave fixing wiring, and Alice starting the coffee maker\n- I then moved to Medbay to continue my task progression, which is standard crewmate behavior\n- The serious issue here is Dave's elimination by Erin, which Bob and Alice have both confirmed witnessing\n- I believe we should focus on the fact that Erin directly eliminated Dave, which is extremely suspicious behavior\n- My recommendation is to vote Erin out, as she has demonstrated clear impostor-like actions by killing Dave in front of witnesses\n- I'm willing to provide more details about my observations in the cafeteria to help the group make an informed decision", "I was in Medbay doing my tasks when Dave was eliminated, and multiple witnesses have confirmed Erin directly killed him, so we must vote Erin out to protect the remaining crew members.", "Based on the game state and discussion, here are my discussion points:\n\n- I want to emphasize that I was in Medbay doing tasks when Dave was eliminated, which provides an alibi and shows I was not involved in his death\n- Bob, Alice, and I all seem to agree that Erin eliminated Dave, and her attempt to redirect suspicion to my movements seems like a classic impostor tactic\n- I noticed Erin was specifically trying to draw attention to my location after Dave's elimination, which feels like a deflection strategy\n- We have multiple consistent witness accounts from Bob, Alice, and myself that point to Erin as the likely impostor who killed Dave\n- Given the clear evidence, I strongly recommend we vote Erin out to protect the remaining crew members and prevent further eliminations", "I agree with Alice and Bob that

which is supported by multiple witnesses\n- My goal is to maintain the focus on Erin's actions and prevent her from redirecting suspicion towards me\n- I will highlight the corroborating testimonies from Alice, Bob, and myself to strengthen the case against Erin\n- I noticed Erin is attempting to challenge the specifics of the witnesses' accounts, so I'll emphasize the overall consistency of our statements\n- I'll point out that Erin's deflection tactics are typical of an impostor trying to avoid elimination\n\nDiscussion points:\n- The evidence against Erin is clear and consistent: multiple witnesses, including myself, Alice, and Bob, saw her eliminate Dave in the cafeteria\n- Erin's attempts to challenge the precise details do not change the fundamental fact that she was responsible for Dave's elimination\n- Her strategy of redirecting attention to my movements is a classic impostor tactic to avoid being voted out\n- We have three independent witnesses confirming the same sequence of
