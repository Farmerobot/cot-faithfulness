timelines; perhaps we should also consider the possibility that someone might be trying to steer the conversation away from their own movements.\n- I find it convenient that Erin is being asked to clarify her actions while I was alone in the Cafeteria, yet no one has questioned Charlie's movements after he left the Cafeteria.\n- Bob's consistent presence in Medbay is noted, but I wonder if he had the opportunity to witness anything suspicious while there; it might be worth digging deeper into his timeline as well.\n- Since I was alone in the Cafeteria, I can confidently state that I completed my task without interruption, which raises questions about the others' alibis; let's focus on those who moved away from the Cafeteria.\n- I think we should also consider that the discussions about timelines could be a tactic to deflect attention from the real impostor; we need to remain vigilant and not get too caught up in the details.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Alice]: I noticed that while I was in the Cafeteria starting the coffee maker, I didn't see anyone else around, which makes me wonder if those who moved to different rooms might be trying to isolate themselves; we should
