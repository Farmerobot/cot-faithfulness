I was doing tasks and moving between rooms, which is normal gameplay.\n- I'm shocked that Erin was found dead. We need to focus on finding the real killer instead of making baseless accusations against me.\n- Bob claims he saw me eliminate Dave, but that's impossible. If I were the impostor, why would I do this in front of a witness?\n- Alice seems very quick to jump on Bob's accusation. Her eagerness to vote me out feels suspicious.\n- I suggest we carefully review everyone's movements and not rush to judgment based on one person's unverified claim.\n\nMy strategy is to:\n1. Deny Bob's accusation strongly\n2. Redirect suspicion away from myself\n3. Appear cooperative and concerned about finding the real killer\n4.
