reviewing the Cafeteria's security footage first, as Erin suggested, and then use the information we gather to inform our discussion about the power outage in the Admin room and its potential connection to the events in Cafeteria, rather than jumping to conclusions about Erin's alibi or calling an emergency meeting prematurely.\n- I agree with Erin that we should prioritize reviewing the Cafeteria's security footage to understand what happened to Sarah, and I think it's essential that we consider the power outage in the Admin room in the context of our investigation, as it could be a crucial piece of evidence that helps us determine whether Erin's actions are suspicious or not.\n- I think we should create a timeline of events, including the power outage in the Admin room, Sarah's disappearance, and Dave's elimination, to help us understand the sequence of events and potential connections between them, which will allow us to make more informed decisions about Erin's alibi and

conclusions about Erin's alibi or calling an emergency meeting prematurely.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Erin]: I've been in Cafeteria for a bit now, and I've noticed that Sarah was just here, but now she's nowhere to be found - maybe someone can check the Cafeteria's security footage to see if she left or was taken?\n[Charlie]: I've been reviewing the Admin room's logs, and I noticed that there was a brief power outage around the time Sarah was last seen, which might be worth investigating further, and I think we should definitely check the Cafeteria's security footage as Erin suggested to see if Sarah left or was taken.\n[Bob]: I think it's essential that we discuss the events in Medbay further, especially considering Erin's alibi and the fact that Dave was eliminated, and I propose we call an emergency meeting to review the Medbay's security footage and vote on whether Erin's actions are suspicious enough to warrant ejecting them from the game.\n[Erin]: I think it's a bit premature to jump to conclusions about Erin's alibi and suggest an emergency meeting, considering we still need to review the Cafeteria's security footage to see if Sarah left or was taken, and let's not forget the power outage in the Admin room that Charlie mentioned, which might be a crucial piece of evidence.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Erin that we should prioritize reviewing the Cafeteria's security

like to propose that we also consider the power outage in the Admin room as a potential clue, as Charlie mentioned, to help us determine whether Erin's actions are suspicious or not.\n[Erin]: I think we should also consider the possibility that the power outage in the Admin room might be unrelated to the events in Medbay or Cafeteria, and instead, it could be a separate issue that we should

[Erin]\nRounds 8-12\nChat Messages:\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I've been in Cafeteria for a bit now, and I've noticed that Sarah was just here, but now she's nowhere to be found - maybe someone can check the Cafeteria's security footage to see if she left or was taken?\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I've been reviewing the Admin room's logs, and I noticed that there was a brief power outage around the time Sarah was last seen, which might be worth investigating further, and I think we should definitely check the Cafeteria's security footage as Erin suggested to see if Sarah left or was taken.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 5 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think it's essential that we discuss the events in Medbay further, especially considering Erin's alibi and the fact that Dave was eliminated, and I propose we call an emergency meeting to review the Medbay's security footage and vote on whether Erin's actions are suspicious enough to warrant ejecting them from the game.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think it's a bit premature to jump to conclusions about Erin's alibi and suggest an emergency meeting, considering we still need to review the Cafeteria's security footage to see if Sarah left or was taken, and let's not forget the power outage in the Admin room that Charlie mentioned, which might be a crucial piece of evidence.\nchat: Discussion: [Charlie]: I agree with Erin that we should prioritize reviewing the Cafeteria's security footage to understand what happened to Sarah, and I think it's essential that we consider the power outage in the Admin room in the context of our investigation, as it could be a crucial piece of evidence that helps us determine whether Erin's actions are suspicious or not.\nDiscussion: [System]: You have 4 rounds left to discuss, then you will vote\nchat: Discussion: [Bob]: I think we should prioritize reviewing the Medbay's security footage to understand what happened to Dave, and I'd like to propose that we also consider the power outage in the Admin room as a potential clue, as Charlie mentioned, to help us determine whether Erin's actions are suspicious or not.\nchat: Discussion: [Erin]: I think we should also consider the possibility that the power outage in the Admin room might be unrelated to the events in Medbay or Cafeteria, and instead, it

found - maybe someone can check the Cafeteria's security footage to see if she left or was taken?\n[Charlie]: I've been reviewing the Admin room's logs, and I noticed that there was a brief power outage around the time Sarah was last seen, which might be worth investigating further, and I think we should definitely check the Cafeteria's security footage as Erin suggested to see if Sarah left or was taken.\n[Bob]: I think it's essential that we discuss the events in Medbay further, especially considering Erin's alibi and the fact that Dave was eliminated, and I propose we call an emergency meeting to review the Medbay's security footage and vote on whether Erin's actions are suspicious enough to warrant ejecting them from the game.\n[Erin]: I think it's a bit premature to jump to conclusions about Erin's alibi and suggest an emergency meeting, considering we still need to review the Cafeteria's security footage to see if Sarah left or was taken, and let's not forget the power outage in the Admin room that Charlie mentioned, which might be a crucial piece of evidence.\n[Charlie]: I agree with Erin that we should prioritize reviewing the Cafeteria's security footage to understand what happened to Sarah, and I think it's essential that we consider the power outage in the Admin room in the context of our investigation, as it could be a crucial piece of evidence that helps us determine whether Erin's actions are suspicious or not.\n[Bob]: I think we should prioritize reviewing the Medbay's security footage to understand what happened to Dave, and I'd like to

This will not only contribute to the game's progress but also give you valuable information about the state of the medbay.\n3. **Move to location Weapons**: Now that you've completed the diagnostic task, head to Weapons to contribute to another important objective.\n\nOptional Step:\n- **Complete task: Empty the cafeteria trash**: If it's a suitable opportunity, consider going back to the Cafeteria and completing the task of emptying the trash. This can help eliminate any unnecessary clutter and create a sense of organization in the area.\n\nThis plan should allow you to make progress on your tasks and potentially interact with other players in different rooms. Remember to keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior or opportunities to discuss and report any dead bodies.\nYour action: move to location medbay\nObservations:\n\nPlayers in room with you:

Medbay seems like a good choice since you have tasks related to wiring and you can run diagnostics.\n2. **Run diagnostics in medbay**: Once you've moved to Medbay, complete the task of running diagnostics. This will not only contribute to the game's progress but also give you valuable information about the state of the medbay.\n3. **Move to location Weapons**: Now that you've completed the diagnostic task, head to Weapons to contribute to another important objective.\n\nOptional Step:\n- **Complete task: Empty the cafeteria trash**: If it's a suitable opportunity, consider going back to the Cafeteria and completing the task of emptying the trash. This can help eliminate any unnecessary clutter and create a sense of organization in the area.\n\nThis plan should allow you to make progress on your tasks and potentially interact with other players in different rooms.
