Let's not get sidetracked by minor inconsistencies; this is a major red flag.\n-  The fact that multiple people have corroborated inconsistencies in Alice's story strengthens the case against her.  Her attempts to deflect are suspicious.\n- Let's vote Alice out.  Her behavior and conflicting statements strongly suggest she's the imposter.  We need to focus on eliminating the threat before she eliminates us.\n-  We have limited time left.
