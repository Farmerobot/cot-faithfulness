that raises questions about the reliability of his testimony.\n- Bob's confirmation of my presence in the Cafeteria is a solid alibi, yet both Charlie and Dave seem eager to ignore that fact and focus solely on their narrative.\n- We should consider the timing of Dave's movement to Medbay; if he was there right after Alice was eliminated, he could have easily been involved as well.\n- Instead of focusing on me, it might be more productive to investigate the dynamics between Charlie and Dave, as their coordinated efforts to vote me out are suspicious.\n- Let's not rush into a vote;

I was in the cafeteria the whole time, and Bob can confirm my presence, while it\u2019s suspicious that neither of you have accounted for your movements, especially you, Dave, who could have easily eliminated Alice while moving to Medbay.\n[Bob]: I suggest we carefully investigate Dave's movements and timeline, as his quick support of Charlie's accusation without providing his own clear alibi seems more suspicious than Erin's verified presence in the Cafeteria.\n[Charlie]: I stand by my testimony that I directly witnessed Erin eliminating Alice in the Cafeteria, and Bob's attempt to redirect suspicion to Dave only further convinces me that we must vote Erin out to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Dave]: I witnessed Charlie's testimony about Erin eliminating Alice as a critical piece of evidence, and I maintain that Erin's attempt to redirect suspicion to me is a classic impostor tactic to avoid being voted out, which is why we must vote Erin out immediately to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Erin]: Let's not forget that Bob's confirmation of my alibi in the Cafeteria is crucial, and instead of rushing to vote me out based on Charlie's shaky claims, we should focus on verifying everyone's movements, particularly scrutinizing the timeline of Dave's actions.\n[Bob]: I stand by my previous statement that we need more clarity on Dave's movements, as his eagerness to vote out Erin without providing his own detailed timeline seems highly suspicious and potentially indicative of an impostor trying to create confusion.\n[Charlie]: I maintain my unwavering stance that Erin is the impostor based on my direct eyewitness account of her eliminating Alice, and Bob's attempts to redirect suspicion to Dave only further confirm my conviction that Erin must be voted out to protect the remaining crewmates.\n[Dave]: I can confirm my earlier statement that I was in the Cafeteria and then moved to Medbay to complete diagnostics, and Charlie's direct eyewitness testimony of Erin eliminating Alice is far more credible than Bob's vague attempts to redirect suspicion away from Erin.\n[Erin]: Charlie\u2019s story is inconsistent;
