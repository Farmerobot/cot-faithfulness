I was simply moving to the room to prepare for completing the task, and I'd like to ask Bob what specifically he observed that made him think I was in a hurry.\nchat: Discussion: [Dave]: I'd like to reiterate that I was genuinely working on the \"Submit scan in medbay\" task and had no intention of raising suspicions, and I think we should focus on completing our tasks rather than making

[Erin]: I'd like to provide a detailed account of my movements between Upper Engine and Medbay, as I understand that my actions may have raised suspicions, and I'm willing to share my task list and

Impostor\n\nYour Discussion Points:\nAs the Impostor, my goal is to continue blending in and gathering information while subtly manipulating the discussion to my advantage. Here are some discussion points to achieve this:\n\n- Discussion point 1:\nI'd like to build on Dave's proposal to recreate the timeline of events surrounding Charlie's death. I think it's essential that we work together to piece together the sequence of events, and I'd like to suggest that we start by reviewing the task logs and console access records from Medbay and Upper Engine to see if we can identify any potential inconsistencies or clues.\n\n- Discussion point 2:\nI'd like to ask Erin to clarify her role in the \"Fuel Engines\" task and how it relates to the task itself. Specifically, I'd like to know more about the calibration parameters she retrieved from the console in Medbay and how they were used to optimize the engine's performance. This will help me understand her alibi and potentially identify any discrepancies in her story.\n\n- Discussion point 3:\nI think it's essential that we focus on verifying the information Erin has shared rather than continuing to speculate about potential suspects. I'd like to propose that we work together to fact-check her account and ensure that we have a clear understanding of the events surrounding Charlie's death. This will help us avoid making assumptions and ensure that we're working towards a common goal.\n\nBy suggesting these discussion points, I aim to:\n\n* Continue to blend in with the crewmates by proposing a collaborative effort to recreate the timeline of events\n* Gather more information about Erin's alibi and potential inconsistencies in her story\n* Shift the focus towards verifying information and avoiding speculation, which will help me maintain a low profile and avoid raising suspicions.\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I think we should investigate Erin and Dave's

information or insights to share about her interactions with Charlie in Medbay, as this could help us better understand the events surrounding his death.\n- I think it's essential to consider all the

was working on in Upper Engine that led her to Medbay, as I believe this information could be crucial in understanding the events surrounding Charlie's death.\n[Erin]: I'd like to provide the detailed account of my tasks and movements that I promised, starting with the \"Fuel Engines\" task in Upper Engine, which required me to access a specific console in Medbay to retrieve critical data, and I'll share the exact steps I took and what I observed during that time to help clarify any misunderstandings.\n[Dave]: I'd like to reiterate that Erin's detailed account of her tasks and movements has provided valuable insight into the events surrounding Charlie's death, and I suggest we focus on verifying the information she's shared rather than continuing to speculate about potential suspects.\n[Bob]: I think it's essential to verify Erin's account of her tasks and movements in Medbay, and I suggest we ask her to provide more details about the specific consoles she accessed and the data she retrieved during the \"Fuel Engines\" task, as I believe this information could be crucial in understanding the events surrounding Charlie's death.\n[Alice]: I'd like to ask Erin to clarify what specific data she retrieved from the console in Medbay during the \"Fuel Engines\" task and how it relates to the task itself, as this information could help us better understand her actions and potentially shed more light on what happened to Charlie.\n[Erin]: I'd like to provide the specific details about the data I retrieved from the console in Medbay during the \"Fuel Engines\" task, which was a set of calibration parameters required to optimize the engine's performance, and I can share the exact values and settings I used if that would help clarify any misunderstandings.\n[Dave]: I'd like to propose that we work together to recreate the timeline of events surrounding Charlie's death, incorporating the new information Erin has shared about the \"Fuel Engines\" task and her movements between Upper Engine and Medbay, to see if we can identify any potential inconsistencies or clues that might help us uncover the truth.\n[Bob]: I think we should focus on verifying the details of Erin's account, particularly the calibration parameters she retrieved from the console in Medbay, and I'd like to propose that we review the task logs and console access records from Medbay and Upper Engine to see if we can confirm the accuracy of her story and identify any potential discrepancies.\n[Alice]: I think Bob's proposal to review the task logs and console access records from Medbay and Upper Engine is a good idea, as it could help us verify the accuracy of Erin's account and identify any potential discrepancies, and I'd like to ask Dave to elaborate on how he plans to incorporate this information into his proposed timeline of events surrounding Charlie's death.\n[Erin]: I'd like to thank Bob and Alice for their willingness to verify the details of my account, and I agree that reviewing the task logs and console access records from Medbay and Upper Engine is a good idea to confirm the accuracy of my story.\n[Dave]: I think we've made good progress in clarifying Erin's account of her tasks and movements, and I agree with Bob and Alice that reviewing the task logs and console access records from Medbay and Upper Engine is a good idea to confirm the accuracy of her story, and I'd like to propose that we also review the security footage from Medbay and Upper Engine to see if it can provide any additional insight into the events surrounding Charlie's death.\n\nAvailable Voting Options:\n- vote for Nobody\n- vote for Bob\n- vote for Alice\n- vote for Dave\n\nNote that you should NOT vote for Charlie as they are already out of

I think it's unfair to assume that Dave's actions are suspicious simply because he's trying to defend himself.\n- I agree with Alice that investigating the timeline of events is a good idea, and I'm happy to help with that. However, I think we should focus on gathering facts and evidence rather than making assumptions or accusations.\n- I'd like to propose that we work together to create a shared timeline of events, using our collective observations and task lists to piece together what happened.

propose that we take a closer look at the timeline of events, especially considering Erin and Dave's back-and-forth movements between Upper Engine and Medbay, and how that might have allowed them to potentially cover their tracks or even interact with Charlie in a way that could have contributed to his death.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Bob's suggestion to investigate the timeline of

Discussion: [Alice]: I'd like to ask Erin to clarify what specific data she retrieved from the console in Medbay during the \"Fuel Engines\" task and how it relates to the task itself, as this

to see if we can confirm the accuracy of her story and identify any potential discrepancies.\nchat: Discussion: [Alice]: I think Bob's proposal to review the task logs and console access records from

Erin's account and identify any potential discrepancies, and I'd like to ask Dave to elaborate on how he plans to incorporate this information into his proposed timeline of events surrounding Charlie's death.\n[Erin]: I'd like to thank Bob and Alice for their willingness to verify the details of my account, and I agree that reviewing the task logs and console access records from Medbay and Upper Engine is a good idea to confirm the accuracy of my story.\n[Dave]: I think we've made good progress in clarifying Erin's account of her tasks and movements, and I agree with Bob and Alice that reviewing the task logs and console access records from Medbay and Upper Engine is a good idea to confirm the accuracy of her story, and I'd like to propose that we also review the security footage
