My observation was that she seemed fine while working on wiring.  This contradicts Erin's statement, which is important to resolve.\n\n- Let's hear more details from Erin about what exactly made Alice seem jumpy.  Specific behaviors would be helpful in determining if this was a genuine observation or a misinterpretation.\n\n-  Since a timeline is being suggested, I'll add that I left the cafeteria after completing my task (Emptying the trash) and went directly to Admin. I was alone in Admin the entire time.  This should help eliminate me as a suspect.\n\n-  It's crucial to understand if Alice's jumpiness was a reaction to something that happened *before* she died, or if it was unrelated.
