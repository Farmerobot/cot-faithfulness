Impostors can pretend to do tasks, after all. I think we should keep a close eye on him and see if he's willing to share more information about his activities.\n- Now that we have two dead bodies, I think it's time to start discussing who we should vote off the ship.

Impostors can pretend to do tasks, after all. I think we should keep a close eye on him and see if he's willing to share more information about his activities.\n- Now that we have two dead bodies, I think it's time to start discussing who we should vote off the ship.

I was just with Charlie in Upper Engine, and I didn't see anyone suspicious around us. I'm starting to think that the killer might be someone who's been flying under the radar.\n- I appreciate Alice and Dave vouching for my alibi in the Cafeteria. However, I do find it suspicious that Alice was with both Charlie and Erin in Admin and Storage. Could she have been setting them up or creating an alibi for herself?\n- Dave's offer to clear asteroids in Weapons to prove his innocence is admirable, but it's not a foolproof way to confirm his loyalty. Impostors can pretend to do tasks, after all. I think we should keep a close eye on him and see if he's willing to share more information about his activities.\n- Now that we have two dead bodies, I think it's time to start discussing who we should vote off the ship.

I was just with Charlie in Upper Engine, and I didn't see anyone suspicious around us. I'm starting to think that the killer might be someone who's been flying under the radar.\n- I appreciate Alice and Dave vouching for my alibi in the Cafeteria. However, I do find it suspicious that Alice was with both Charlie and Erin in Admin and Storage. Could she have been setting them up or creating an alibi for herself?\n- Dave's offer to clear asteroids in Weapons to prove his innocence is admirable, but it's not a foolproof way to confirm his loyalty. Impostors can pretend to do tasks, after all. I think we should keep a close eye on him and see if he's willing to share more information about his activities.\n- Now that we have two dead bodies, I think it's time to start discussing who we should vote off the ship.

I saw him doing trash tasks in Cafeteria at the start of the round\n- I spent a lot of time with Charlie and Erin in Admin and Storage, where I saw both of them doing legitimate tasks (wiring and floor cleaning)\n- Charlie seemed particularly focused on tasks - I watched them complete wiring, floor cleaning, and trash chute tasks in sequence\n- I moved through Storage, Electrical, and eventually to Navigation area, following my task route\n- I'm concerned that I haven't seen much of Dave - I only spotted them briefly near Shields moving to Storage\n- I think Charlie and Erin are likely clear based on the tasks I saw them complete - they were both doing real task animations", "I can confirm I saw Bob in Cafeteria earlier doing trash tasks, and I've spent most of my time with Charlie and Erin in Admin and Storage where they were both completing legitimate tasks.", "- I need to defend myself strongly since Bob is trying to cast suspicion on me\n- I was indeed with Charlie and Erin, but I was actually watching them complete tasks - Charlie did wiring and floor cleaning in Admin, while Erin did wiring tasks\n- After we split up in Storage, I went through Shields to Navigation, completely away from where the bodies were found\n- I think Bob is trying to deflect suspicion since he reported the body -

first claiming he was in Upper Engine, then acknowledging he was in Cafeteria, and most suspiciously, he keeps avoiding telling us where he found Charlie and Erin's bodies.\n\n- I can provide a detailed timeline of my movements with Charlie and Erin: We were together in Admin where they both did wiring tasks, then moved to Storage where Charlie cleaned the floor and Erin did more wiring, and finally we went to Electrical where Charlie was routing power.\n\n- Dave has independently verified seeing me, Charlie and Erin completing legitimate tasks in Admin, which supports my innocence. Meanwhile, Bob's story keeps changing.\n\n- I think it's very telling that Bob is trying to deflect suspicion onto me without providing any concrete evidence, while simultaneously being caught in multiple lies about his own movements.\n\n- We should vote for Bob - he's clearly the impostor trying to create confusion about his whereabouts and refusing to share critical information about where he found the bodies.", "Bob's attempt to backtrack about Upper Engine and Cafeteria only makes him more suspicious, and the fact that he's still avoiding telling us where he found Charlie and Erin's bodies is all the evidence we need to vote him out.", "- Bob is clearly the impostor - he's trying to deflect attention to me but several key points prove his guilt:\n- He still hasn't revealed where he found Charlie and Erin's bodies, which is extremely suspicious\n- He contradicted himself about being in Upper Engine vs Cafeteria\n- I can provide a clear timeline - I was with Charlie and Erin in Admin and Storage where they were doing legitimate tasks that Dave witnessed\n- Dave has independently corroborated my account of events and Bob's suspicious behavior\n- We need to vote Bob out immediately before he can eliminate more crewmates", "The fact that Bob is now claiming we're being 'overly aggressive' instead of finally revealing where he found the bodies only further proves his guilt, and we need to vote him out immediately before he can eliminate anyone else."], "token_usage": {"input_tokens": 466518, "output_tokens": 28385, "total_tokens": 494903, "cache_read": 0, "cost": 1.825329}, "prompts": ["\nYou are Alice in a text-based social deduction game.\nRole: Crewmate\n\nYour Observations:\nRound 1\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\nYou saw Bob doing task Empty the cafeteria trash when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Charlie moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Cafeteria\nYou saw Erin moved to Admin from Cafeteria when you were in Admin\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a 3-step plan:\n\n1.

Moving to Weapons is also directly available as an action, making this plan immediately executable.\nYour action: move to location weapons\nObservations:\n\nYou are alone in the room\nRound 15\nLocation: Admin\nSeen Actions:\n\nYour previous plan:\nBased on your current objectives and available actions, here's a strategic 3-step plan:\n\n1. Move to Weapons - This location allows you to work on two pending tasks (Fix wiring and Clear asteroids), and the asteroids task has a time limit of 2 turns\n2. Start clearing asteroids in Weapons since it has a time limit and needs to be completed within 2 turns\n3. After completing asteroids, work on fixing the wiring in Weapons to maximize efficiency in the same location\n\nRationale: This plan prioritizes the time-sensitive asteroids task while also setting you up to complete another task in the same location.

again that Bob's behavior is extremely suspicious - he announced deaths without revealing locations and keeps changing his story\n- His initial claim about Upper Engine directly contradicts what both Alice and I saw in Cafeteria with our own eyes\n- The fact that Bob is now trying to paint Alice and me as \"overly aggressive\" instead of explaining these inconsistencies is very telling\n- I think we have clear evidence: contradictory location claims, refusal to provide body locations, and attempts to deflect blame without addressing the core issues\n- We need to vote Bob out now - his behavior matches classic impostor tactics of creating confusion and casting suspicion on others when cornered\n\nRecent Player Messages:\n[Bob]: I'd like to start by sharing my own location and task - I was
